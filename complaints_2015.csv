The land is part of a subdivision and tax information wo n't be available until the next tax roll assessment. Until that assessment is complete, I pay out of pocket to the original owner of all of the parcels, my share of the taxes. What Quicken is doing however is forcing me to make Escrow payments equal to the tax of all of the parcels knowing that the amount is incorrect and significantly overstated. What I am told is that absent having the specific amount for my parcel, they can collect the amount of all of the parcels. And yes they know this is in error and acknowledge that it is in error.

266,2015-10-19,Credit card,,Customer service / Customer relations,,"Recently I contacted my credit card Capital One to find out how much the minimum amount was due for payment and was told that {$120.00} would suffice. Once I paid the bill a few weeks later I had a family emergency where my dogs XXXX was XXXX and we raced to the hospital to tend to him. At the time I needed gas so that I could return back with the family and I had my sister and my XXXX mother in the car with me. Over the internet the credit card indicated that I had monies available. To our shock and surprise, the card was declined because I later found out that there was a hold on the credit card. I can not explain the weight of how embarrassed and mortified I was in front of my family and the gas station attendant. Why would the Capital One website indicate that monies were available? To add insult to injury, the customer service representatives were clearly unfazed by my plea and situation. They were rude, unprofessional, abrupt and quickly disconnected the call. Prior to the disconnect, I was also told that I had to pay an additional {$75.00} with no explanation. At this point, the responses I received were callus, rude and abrupt. No one ever explained where this amount came from however when I checked back and got a supervisor I was told that I did n't owe {$75.00} because the money was waived for some odd reason. I am still unaware why I was charged initially and why it was waived. Maybe it waived due to the cruel and horrible treatment I received. To date, I needed the monies for food for my family since the amount available had changed from gas money to {$59.00} being available. Realizing that this company communicates one thing and is not always forthcoming, I decided to contact them before I embarrass myself it I used the card and it was declined. Now I am being told that I need to pay {$24.00} because when I previously paid {$120.00} I needed to pay {$140.00}. Why was n't this information made available to me previously? Why was I charged {$75.00} and then it was waived? Why does it say that I have available credit over the internet and phone line when the card has a freeze/hold on it? This company is unethical, unprofessional and constantly misinforming me regarding my bill. I have no idea what is going on and they need to stop.

My sister happens to manage a medical office and she verified that the service providers XXXX the insurance that was used, and not the person who signs the form accepting responsibility.

At this time, it was discovered that there was already a credit card account under my social security number at XXXX. This was how we first found the fraud. The nice man at XXXX bank was very helpful and we met about XXXX more times to resolve the issue. At the time, It was not evident if the identity theft was intentional or if someone had accidently entered my social security number. Regardless, XXXX fixed this in their systems, canceled the other guys credit card, and allowed me to open my first checking account with XXXX under my rightful social security number. When I applied for the credit card, it was understood that I would have to wait a couple months because the "" incident '' put a fraud alert on my credit/social security account. When the time passed, I reached out to all XXXX of the credit agencies ( XXXX, Transunion, and XXXX ) to follow up regarding my credit and get my credit report. Little did I know, this was the start of a 3 year battle trying to see that report. 
From that day forward, I have been trying to get help getting my credit report. Getting a HUMAN on the phone with these credit agencies is nearly impossible. Not only are there a plethora of different numbers and departments to call, but every single time you call, you get connected to an automated robot, which then they offer you a long list of Numeral options that are vague and confusing and within each have a web of more options until you reach the end of XXXX and it either A ) HANGS UP or B ) Does not give you any option that fits what you are looking for and you get automatically disconnected or C ) instructs you to "" go online and fill out XXXX form or mail to XXXX address ''. The very rare times that you do get connected to a HUMAN, every single single exact time, the individual has directed me elsewhere ... ..elsewhere meaning the following options : A ) Another XXXX B ) a website or C ) another person who eventually passes me along as well ( repeat and repeat ... ). 
Now let 's talk about why the website option is not helpful. When I first called to follow up regarding my credit and the fraud with the agencies 3 years ago, that was the first place they directed me to Request my credit report - through the website. So I do that and after putting in all of my information and answering the questions and after I hit "" Submit '' a message of some variation of this would follow : '' We can not identify your account based on the information you provided, please call or mail the following information to this address '' or "" ERROR -- we can not access this page. Please call this number XXXX ''. There is some type of block on my account that does not allow ANYONE to access it within the system. That is why whenever I try to get help online, I am always blocked before getting to the next step because my information appears invalid and then I am directed to call a number. And when I get someone on the phone and they try to help, they always come to a dead end where they can not access any information for me about my account because some type of error pops up that blocks them out. 
I have called each of the agencies countless of times through the years, filled out forms, requests, complaints, mailed in packages of personal information including tax returns, utility bills I pay, my rent bill, a copy of my social security card, my license, passport, XXXX, however I always get the same notice and response -- that they can not identify me and to please send more information or call some other number. So the bottom line 3 years later is that no one CAN ACCESS MY ACCOUNT AND NOONE KNOWS HOW TO FIX IT. I call the agencies -- they tell me to go elsewhere or the bureaus. I call the bureaus they tell me to go back to the agencies.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NY,10022,,Consent provided,Web,11/09/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1646843

As a result, the card value can be greatly reduced from the original value even before initial activation. 

The story : My kids received netspend debit cards from their grandparents for XXXX, each with {$75.00} on them. My parents thought they were giving the kids gift cards, not reloadable debit cards.

american express claims that since the merchant allegedly try to contact me that the issue could have been resolved however indicated to them that no one has contacted me other then to purchase more items at a higher quality. American Express seems to be taking the side of the other party without fully taking into consideration of what I have endure by making a purchase using their American Express protection plan. It seems as if they do n't want to hear my side of the situation and it is making me feel like I am being discriminated against. I have lost money due to purchasing this product and no one has addressed that issue. American Express has also failed to fully investigate the faulty items I received and solely sided with the other party because they claim the other party has offered to replace the item with a similar item. With all due respect if the item I purchased was damaged why would I want to buy the very same item again? I would rather take my business elsewhere. Furthermore I have several of the items which are faulty in my possession.

They also have an excess balance in my escrow account that they should refund to us. This issue began with a reduction in our property tax of {$3700.00}. On XXXX XXXX, I sent a letter to Bayview with a copy of the tax bill ( attached ) showing the reduced payment of {$3700.00}, but Bayview had already paid the full amount of the tax {$7400.00}. In addition to the refund Bayview did not decrease the amount of the monthly escrow impound, which added to the excess in our escrow account. 

On XXXX XXXX we received a form letter from Bayview that they received our inquiry and that we would receive a reply. On XXXX XXXX The Town of XXXX refunded the tax overpayment of {$3700.00} to Bayview. On XXXX XXXX at XXXX I called Bayview and spoke to a rep named XXXX . XXXX informed my that Bayview had still not posted the tax refund to our account, but that she would order an escrow anylysis. On XXXX XXXX we received a check for {$2600.00} from Bayview indicating it was an overage refund, but there was no further explanation. On XXXX XXXX I called Bayview and and spoke to another representative and asked for a copy of the escrow analysis, which we finally received on XXXX XXXX dated XXXX/XXXX/15. 

The escrow analysis which is attached does not reflect the refund of {$3700.00} and it assumes a monthly impound rate at the higher monthly tax rate creating an excess of {$6500.00} in the escrow account. I called Bayview again on XXXX XXXX and explained this issue and asked to speak to a supervisor, but got nowhere. I told the rep that unless I received a revised escrow analysis by XXXX XXXX I would report them to the Federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. So here we are. 

Bayview should refund the overage in my escrow account of {$6500.00} which represents the tax refund noted above and the overage they have collected from me anticipating a higher property tax. Bavyview should also reduce the monthly escrow impound rate to {$1100.00} per month. Additionally if there 's any opportunity to fine them for keeping my money it should be pursued. I 'm certain that if they are doing this to me ( holding excess escrow ) they are doing the same to others, which is consumer fraud as it appears they are using customer money to finance other activities. Otherwise why make it so difficult for a customer to get resolution of an issue? Lastly I have always been concerned that Bayview identifies itself on the phone as a debt collector, not a mortgage servicer.

I know this because I used them to refinance my student loans recently. They advertise interest rates that would clearly be interpreted by any reasonable person as annualized rates and even call the interest rates "" Annual Percentage Rates '' in the loan documents but they actually compound this rate on a daily basis, making the effective annualized rate significantly higher than that which is being advertised. I carefully reviewed the loan documents I received and only in one place, buried deep in the disclosure, does it say interest is accrued on a daily basis, and even that description is confusing because it fails to disclose that the actual interest rate a borrower will pay on an annual basis is higher than the "" Annual Percentage Rate '' because of the daily compounding of interest ( which I think is a very material omission ). I genuinely believe SoFi is secretly robbing indebted students of XXXX dollars PER STUDENT by engaging in these predatory tactics and I believe action needs to be taken against them immediately. SoFi includes a well-crafted arbitration clause in their loan documents and the clause prohibits class arbitration, which effectively prevents any borrower from bringing a claim against them. I would be happy to represent myself against them, and luckily the agreement states each party pays its own legal expenses unless a claim is frivolous, but the fees of the arbitrators would quickly dwarf the amount at issue in my individual case, WHICH IS WHY I NEED YOUR HELP. You are the only available remedy for these kinds of shameful, predatory tactics. SoFi is a HUGE ORGANIZATION and the effect of taking action against them would benefit XXXX students. You have the ability to do a lot of good here ; please do n't just let it pass you by. This is wrong, legally and morally, and you should do something about it.

A few days past and I received a provisional credit to my account for {$1000.00} and {$98.00} for the XXXX checks which did not add up to my initial deposit. There may have been a discrepency with the cash amount listed in the dispute due to the fact that I had counted the cash hours beforehand then spent {$40.00} of the {$1000.00} prior to the deposit. I had advised the representative at M & T when making the dispute of this.

I have been a long standing customer of M & T and am beyond concerned as to their banking practice and consumer protection capabilities.

14745,2015-09-03,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Don't agree with fees charged,"From about XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX, I borrowed a total of {$120000.00} in principal from Sallie Mae to complete my undergrad studies at XXXX University. The interest rate was exorbitant, given that I did not have good credit. My mother co-signed on all three loans ; I was the student borrower, but, to my surprise, Sallie Mae omitted my name from XXXX of the XXXX loans and processed them entirely under my mother 's name. Therefore, she is burdened with my debt to her name. 

A lot happened since graduation, including being unemployed for 1.5 years and not being able to honor payment arrangements, or meet the payment amount that Sallie Mae demanded. I sought lower monthly payments and was told by Sallie Mae that I qualified for a reduced interest rate, which lowered my payments at the time, but I was not informed that by accepting the lower interest rate, the loan term doubled. Whenever I was unable to meet the payment amounts, Sallie Mae blatantly rejected my payment offers and proceeded to badger me with hundreds of calls and threats ; one of its reps ( either a Sallie Mae employee or the agency that was collecting on its behalf ) called my mother 's place of work and discussed the matter with her supervisor. Prior to getting married, a Sallie Mae representative called my home phone and proceeded to discuss my affairs with my then fiance, though I had not given permission for such to occur. 

The total that I owe has ballooned to over {$220000.00}, due in part to interest, and also due in part to monies that were added to the principal every time a requested deferment was processed. I was also charged a total of {$150.00} to defer the loans ( {$50.00} each ) per deferment occurrence. Several collection agencies have managed my Sallie Mae accounts in the last four years, and I recently completed the latest payment arrangement with XXXX XXXX for {$500.00} per month for all three accounts, because that was all I could afford to pay. 

I am overwhelmed by my debt and the constant collection efforts. I am desperate to reduce the debt and get an affordable settlement that I can manage to pay monthly, rather than as a lump sum. Sallie Mae or its collection agency informed that it would be willing to "" forgive '' the remainder of the loan if I make a one-time payment of {$100000.00}. If I had {$100000.00}, I would not have to be hounded by their collections efforts. 

I think Sallie Mae 's lending to student borrowers is predatory, just like what banks did to unassuming home loan borrowers. I am desperate for assistance and feel hopeless about my future. I will never be able to own a home and have good credit. My enormous debt has been a cause of contention between me and my now husband, because after he learned about my debt via conversation with the collector who called my home, he expressed that it would not be suitable to marry me, given the exposure he would also have as my husband and the fact that I was not transparent about my student loan debts. 

I threatened to expose Sallie Mae 's practice of preying upon poor students, its collection practices, its refusal to cooperate with borrowers during difficult times, as well as the fact that the change in loan terms is not divulged to borrowers. I believe that as a result of my threat, the debt was removed from my credit report, but I believe it might be added back, since the payment arrangement that I honored expired at the end of XXXX, XXXX. 

I implore your agency to examine my case and assist me in any way possible. My loans are now being handled by XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX of XXXX, FL.

( Exhibit 1 ) The restraining notice was issued pursuant to XXXX law, in enforcement of a XXXX judgment. ( Exhibit 2 XXXX XXXX law provides that a restraining notice shall not apply to a bank account that contains less than a statutorily protected minimum amount ( currently {$2100.00} XXXX. If the account contains less than {$2100.00}, the restraining notice is deemed void. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( i ). At the time of the restraint, I had only {$270.00} in my account, far below the statutory minimum of {$2100.00}. Therefore, the restraining notice was void and my account never should have been restrained. 
Upon unlawfully restraining the account, HSBC failed to send me notice and an exemption claim form. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( b ) ( XXXX ). The next day, XXXX XXXX, {$490.00} in unemployment benefits were directly deposited to my account and restrained, even though unemployment benefits are exempt from restraint by law. ( Exhibit 1 ). Shortly thereafter, I attempted to make cash withdrawal from an HSBC branch XXXX, and was only then informed for the first time that the account was frozen. When I complained that my account contained exempt funds, the bank representative told me that there was nothing she could do. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2015, with the help of an advocate from New Economy Project, I reached out to the HSBC XXXX Department and was wrongly told by a representative that the restraint was not governed by XXXX law because the account was opened XXXX. The representative proceeded to place me on hold for over one hour and told me that an attorney from HSBC would contact me during the week, but no attorney ever contacted me. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I reached out to HSBC a second time and was told by a representative to call the following Monday as no one in their Legal Department was available. The following Monday, XXXX XXXX, 2015, I called HSBC for a third time and was not allowed to speak to a bank attorney but was told once more that XXXX law did not apply. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, an attorney from New Economy Project spoke directly with the HSBC XXXX Department and explained that EIPA applies to my account and that the restraint was void, but once again HSBC refused to release the account. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2015, New Economy Project reached out to the creditor 's attorney who agreed that the account should not have been restrained and offered to request that HSBC release the account. The creditor 's attorney informed us that she had received a legal opinion letter from HSBC reiterating an incorrect legal position. HSBC did not share the opinion letter with me or New Economy Project, but apparently the letter stated that EIPA did not apply because the account was opened XXXX. There is no basis in XXXX law for this opinion. To the contrary, the law is quite clear that a XXXX restraining notice does not apply to bank accounts containing less than {$2100.00}, and there is no geographic limitation on this protection. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( i ). 
On XXXX XXXX, 2015, more than XXXX months after the unlawful restraint, HSBC finally released my account, but HSBC still has not refunded the {$100.00} fee.",,HSBC NORTH AMERICA HOLDINGS INC.,NY,11435,,Consent provided,Web,08/17/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1522050

After talking to him for 8 minutes, he explained that he had canceled my subscription, but that the "" system was down '' and that I should call back in an hour. I called back three hours later. This time, Transunion asked for my SSN, full name, mother 's maiden name, date of birth, email address, and security question. I then explained that I had noticed recurring charges on my card for services I had not enrolled in. I asked them to stop the charges. I also asked for a refund for the charges previously made.

The reason for the request, is that there was an account opened with XXXX, at an address that I NEVER resided at- as the account was not opened by me. 

The discovery was made, when I went to apply for credit and was denied. After reviewing my credit profile I realized there was a collection account on my profile for an account that I had not opened. 

I called the collection agency associated with the account ( AFNI ), to advise them of the discrepancy, and inform them that the debt was not mine, and that I never resided at the address that the service was opened. I also advised them that I was upset that my credit was affected as a result, and maintaining a good credit profile was is important to me. I was advised to pay the debt, and I felt the only way to regain good standing with my credit profile was to pay the debt ( even though I did not open the account. ). 

I offered to make a settlement on the account, they did not accept the settlement amount that I offered, and provided a counter offer. I eventually accepted and paid the counter offer- because I was desperate to preserve my credit profile. 

Afni advised that they would NOT remove the item from my profile, because this is NOT what they do- ( even though I made EVERYONE I spoke with aware that I did NOT open the account, and NEVER resided at the address where service was opened ). Because I felt I had no other recourse to attempt to restore my credit, I paid the settlement amount. I stated that this was not fair because I NEVER LIVED at the address where service was opened. 

During my initial telephone conversation with AFNI ( XXXX XXXX, 2015 ) - I gave them my address and telephone number, ( the ONLY address I have resided at for the last 5 years ). Shortly there after, I received a letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2015- stating that I had 30 days to reply to the letter, or they would assume that the debt was valid, and report it to the credit bureaus. However, they had ALREADY reported the debt to the credit reporting agencies- prior to me receiving the letter- giving me NO opportunity to respond- AND they advised me that they would NOT remove the item from my credit report. 

Tell them that you are requesting that this agency be required to remove this item from tourncredit entirely and be instructed to stop extorting funds from people under the threat that they will and can ruin their credit. 

At this time I am requesting that this agency be required to remove this item from my credit report entirely, and be instructed to stop extorting funds from people under the threat that they will ( and can ) ruin their credit!!!!

XXXX XXXX, my single point of contact at Selene Finance, initially stated that the repayment plan had ended, which was the reason for the cancelation albeit a false reason per the attached forbearance agreement, but has since tried to justify the cancelation by stating numerous erroneous and egregious reasons for the repayment plan cancelation as follows:1. Repayment plan ended in XXXX XXXX. No BPO was performed on the property3. Force-placed insurance was in effect4.

Selene carried on with the abhorrent business servicing practices by instead abruptly canceling the Agreement for suspicious and conflicting reasons - forcing my family into foreclosure - and ultimately penalizing us for the unfair and unlawful actions and wrongdoing of Selene Finance. I find this to not only be detestable but also criminal. 

In reviewing the attached mortgage statement for XX/XX/XXXX, it is daunting as to why Selene Finance 's solution to a financial hardship as a result of financial and XXXX hardships would be to increase the already high payment amount of {$1800.00} by {$250.00} a month for almost a year and then deny us the right to continue to pay the unfair and unreasonable "" forbearance '' amount of {$2000.00}.

There were no options presented to us back in XX/XX/XXXX when Selene Finance abruptly and without cause canceled the Agreement. XXXX XXXX, our single point of contact that we do not trust due to past lies, did state back on XX/XX/XXXX that the Agreement officially ended in XX/XX/XXXX but was extended until there was an issue with a property inspection and property insurance that may or may not have played a role in being kicked out of the Agreement without being provided with permanent mortgage solution options or a decision as outlined in the Agreement. There was no permanent solution offered nor was there a loan modification decision reached per the terms of the Agreement. 

Selene deemed that we no longer met the mysterious guidelines for the Agreement - even though Selene had been accepting payments on our mortgage loan as late as XX/XX/XXXX before canceling it in XX/XX/XXXX - or any other mortgage assistance solutions without providing a substantial reason for the Agreement cancelation and without following through with the promise stated in the Agreement to turn the temporary Agreement into a permanent solution.

I have a relevant case of extreme hardship due to the passing of my husband. Prior to his death I had never been late ever with my mortgage or had any problems. With my husband now gone my finances have changed drastically. I have been asking for assistance from TD Bank but they have and continue to deny me help. I cooperated with them fully providing them with all the documents they asked for including my prior tax documents that showed our combined salaries and what it had become after his death, I also provided my paystubs and his death certificate. The loss of a spouse is not only the greatest grief but the loss of income is truly a great hardship. They played the usual game and I was denied again even though I gave them concrete proof. I needed my loan modified to a smaller payment so that I could keep up the payments, I do n't have far to go to finish paying off the balance. Because TD denied me help, in order to keep up the payments current and on time, I used my savings to supplement my income. Now my savings is gone and there is nothing left to supplement. I am behind, a car repair problem caused a setback in my ability to make payments to them.

From that point on I simply did not answer the phone when I could see that it was from any source I did not know. I told the customer care person I was doing that.

I have a credit of {$38.00} on my account for several months now ( yes I overpayed and Barclays owes me money! ). 

On probing further they revealed that there was a late payment on the account. In reality the late payment was due to a Barclays error and not mine. I had setup an auto-payment on the account almost a month before the next payment was due and upon completion of the setup the confirmation screen told me to cancel any scheduled payments to avoid a double payment which I did since I did not want a double payment. Fast forward a month Barclays did not process the auto payment on the due date. I noticed it within a couple of days and called Barclays customer service regarding the same. The representative accepted the error on their side and reversed the late payment fees and processed the payment for the account for that statement. 

Because Barclays made that mistake on their end I had to go through the inconvenience of giving them a phone call in the first place.

Moreover on top of the fact that my account is in good standing and the error they have noted was an error on their side, the contract never mentions anything around the account being in good standing or not.

I made numerous phone calls to XXXX XXXX, asking for something in writing to prove that our money, in that amount, was being held by them. After all, if their computers went down, how could we prove that they had our {$52000.00}. If I put XXXX cents into a savings account, I get a receipt. XXXX XXXX absolutely refused to provide us with a receipt on paper attesting to the fact that they were holding {$52000.00} of our money. 
Also, they refused to say if they were paying us interest on that money. Apparently, there IS NO law in NY State requiring Banks to pay interest on Flood Insurance Money being held by Banks. WHY, I DO NOT KNOW. I AM SURE THE BANK IS MAKING MONEY ON OUR {$52000.00}. Any money they make on Our money is ours. I am sure they are investing that money, and keeping it. 

I wrote recently to the New York State Department of Financial Services about these XXXX issues. They forwarded a complaint to XXXX XXXX. I received a letter from XXXX XXXX supposedly in answer to my complaint. They did put in writing, in that letter, that they were holding {$52000.00} of our Flood Insurance Money. So finally, the State Agency got that in writing for us after two years. However, XXXX XXXX stonewalled on the issue of interest due us on that money. They filled half of the letter with an answer to an issue that I did not raise, and that was the issue of them releasing our Flood Insurance Money to us. I did not ask them to release any funds yet. They made it appear that they were answering my complaint, but they answered a question that they made up, not my real question. 
Finally, they did not address the issue of whether we were due interest, and if not, why. They stated this : "" Additionally, we recognize XXXX XXXX 's and XXXX XXXX 's concerns over the interest earned on the escrow funds. With the final disbursement of the insurance funds, any interest earned will be released with the draw. "" We realize that no interest has been paid on these escrow funds, because the bank would have issued us a XXXX form. 
We believe this is not fair. There may be as many as XXXX homeowners in New York State with banks holding Flood Insurance funds. They are, we feel strongly, profiting from all of these funds which are not theirs.

The apartment is in New York XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I left my apartment on legal terms as I was supposed to at end of lease and left my new mailing address. I never received any mail or contact from XXXX XXXX at my new address advising that I had a debt to pay for apartment damages. I only received notification directly from this debt collector almost five months later ( enclosed ). The only evidence they sent me is an inspector 's checklist stating the damages, with no pictures. What rooms are the damages in? Even if they had shown pictures, this complex has XXXX residential buildings with XXXX apartments. It would be very easy for them to take pictures of any apartment. I know that I did not make these damages and I want to see pictures prior to me moving in as proof of damages. Also, as I explained to them, New York landlords can not charge for normal wear and tear, and these building are pre-war buildings from the 1950 's. My unit 's floors were original floors. XXXX also renovates EVERY apartment after a move-out so they increase the rent for the next renter. So it is my understanding that any "" fix-ups '' needed would have already been done during a renovation. 

It is also my understanding that XXXX is very negligent to their renters. After receiving these charges from the debt collector, I received a 'Thank You ' card ( enclosed ) at my new address thanking me for renewing with XXXX. That shows me that they do not care for their residents to pay attention to the details and they did actually have my new address. They could have sent me these charges themselves so I could handle it directly with XXXX versus sending the charges directly to a debt collector. In fact, if anyone were to look at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX, they would see how much debt they are trying to recover. This is just another reason why I think they are just trying to pinch every penny they can out of their residents.

During the transaction, my mother, who is a senior citizen on a fixed income, asked if the dealer offered free or low-interest financing. We were told we could get the snowblower financed for 18 months at zero interest. We agreed, and the dealer proceeded with the transaction. My mother and I both have excellent credit. Prior to closing the transaction, the dealer informed us that the finance company, XXXX, is charging an additional {$50.00} fee for the financing. We were not provided with another alternative to finance the machine but felt the price of the unit was good, so we signed the paperwork with the dealer. We realized a few days later that this was a mistake. In the meantime, the snowblower had been delivered. 

I contacted XXXX and spoke with a representative, inquiring if the {$50.00} fee could be waived or reduced. The representative told me that they do not do that. I then asked if the financing could be cancelled and was told that the dealer, who had already been paid by XXXX, could return the funds. I then contacted the dealer and asked if he would reverse the payment from XXXX, and I would pay him outright on my mother 's behalf, and then she could pay me back over time ( which is what we should have done in the first place ). The dealer told me that he would need to contact XXXX to see what procedure he would need to follow to return the funds. Upon subsequent follow-up with the dealer, he told me that XXXX told him that the transaction could not be reversed, which is not what the XXXX representative had told me. So who to believe? Now it seems that we are stuck with the {$50.00} fee. 

I realize that, by signing the paperwork to initiate the financing, we do n't have much recourse on getting the {$50.00} back. My complaint, though, is that for an {$800.00} purchase, a {$50.00} "" document prep fee '' ( what XXXX is calling it ) is too much. The customer is enticed with the offer of zero percent financing for 18 months, but it 's not zero percent. On an {$800.00} purchase, {$50.00} is actually 4 % annually, no matter what they call it. I believe that this practice is deceptive.

XXXX, XXXX XXXXFederal Consumer Protection BureauTo Whom It May Concern : XXXX XXXX 2014 XXXX Mortgage sold my mortgage to Carrington Mortgages Services XXXX. From the mortgages Origin to this date I have never been late or missed a payment. 

Recently I have tried to refinance some of my properties and having pulled my credit report my Banker noticed in the comment section of all three agencies "" Mortgage in Forbearance '' I called Carrington to find out why this was on my credit reports and I was told I had to make a written request for an investigation. I asked to speak with a supervisor to explain why they could n't tell me why a mortgage that has never had a payment missed would have such a notation on it. After being put on hold for 15 minutes the attendant said to me that there were a number of mortgages recently bought that had errors noted on the reports. He said I would be receiving a letter explaining this and the credit reporting agencies would be updated with that correction and removal of the erroneous comment. I asked for an email of the letter and was told they could not do thatTwo and half weeks have passed with no letter in the mail. I called today and was told I would have to send a letter requesting the letter they said they would send 2 weeks ago. 
I flat out refused and asked to speak to a supervisor. Again being put on hold for 15 minutes the attendant came back to say that he sent the request to the document department and I should be receiving the letter or their error in several days. 

Since my first contact with this company I have been treated like some kind of deadbeat. First by their greeting on the phone of "" We are a debt collector attempting to collect a debt '' and subsequently their comment on an otherwise pristine credit report. XXXX times after asking to speak to a supervisor the attendants returned to say I did n't have to do what they insisted I do to get an answer in the first place. 

This is no way to treat a customer and to do fair business. My hope is that Carrington Mortgage Services is reprimanded for their failures to service me as good customer, treat me fairly and with respect. Needing to demand to speak to a supervisor is no way to get simple requests like an explanation or a letter explaining fault.

Wells Fargo just approved my request for modification under the FHA HAMP program. My income was calculated so much higher then it actually is and all I receive is basic pay stubs. I questioned the dates of pay stubs being used and Wells Fargo advised me they were dated from XXXX and XXXX. This does not make any sense as I have been submitting pay stubs from XXXX up to XX/XX/XXXX. The income calculated off my 5 and 6 month old stubs was {$10000.00}. If my recent 30 days of income was calculated, it would show my average closer to {$6600.00}. This difference would lower my trial payment ( which is higher then my original payment I could not afford ) by {$400.00} a month. This would help me even if I could save a {$100.00} a month rather than the payment increasing. 

I am appealing the calculations and income used in determining my approved FHA trial payment amount : My income with XXXX is much less than what is being calculated as we no longer get any overtime. It was announced companywide in XX/XX/XXXX no more overtime will be granted and or paid out to employees. 
I am paid weekly and please see my last XXXX consecutive pay amounts:XXXX. XXXX {$1700.00}. XXXX {$1600.00} = {$8200.00} divided by XXXX = {$1600.00} x 52 weeks = {$85000.00}.

For XX/XX/XXXX, the amount should be the same as all my expenses are the same XXXX ( I previously misunderstood the question ) So to my understanding, unreimbursed employee expenses are backed out of the monthly income which for the XX/XX/XXXX year was {$5700.00} divided by 12 months = {$470.00} subtracted from {$7100.00} = {$6600.00} which is a tremendous difference from what was calculated in determining my modified payment of {$2400.00} as my payment was calculated at {$10000.00} as per the trial agreement dated XX/XX/XXXX.

Another 3 weeks went past and I did not hear back from Bank of America. I called them today XXXX/XXXX/2015 and was told that the escalated complaint had been rejected but was not provided with a rationale for why I was not contacted. 

Not only did the bank refuse to honor their promotion, they were deceitful twice to me when I waited the promised credit. During the first 90 day wait period, I was assured twice that I would be receiving the credit. It was not until the 90-day lapse period ended that I was informed I would not be receiving the promised credit. After the re-escalation process, I was promised to be contacted with the results, I was not and I was given no explanation for why I was never contacted - it appeared they were hoping I would simply forget about the issue. Their rationale for not honoring the credit was that I was not a targeted customer, which I do not recall from the promotion ( I read all fine print ). I have attached a sample of the promotion I found online, ( this includes the details of the promotion I used, I am not 100 % sure this is the direct link I applied for my account though ), there is no mention of a targeted customer. Keep in mind that the promotion was visible to any person by a simple internet search - so by definition, every person that ran a search was targeted. Again, this rationale was also not provided to me until 90 days after I had set up an account with above the minimum required {$20000.00} and also set up my direct deposit service.

He agreed to a purchase price of {$520.00}. He sent me a XXXX money order, which seemed fishy but possibly legitimate, for much too much money, XXXX money grams for {$930.00}, or {$1800.00} total. I communicated with him via SMS that i had received too much money, he stated that the extra was for the shipper, and he was having multiple items picked up. He requested that I take out the delta in cash and forward to the shipper via money order, whose name he sent me. This is where I was social engineered, and it retrospect it was not a smart move. 

I then *waited* for the money to show as "" settled '' in my checking account, which i did. I assumed that this meant the money was legitimately in my account and available for withdrawal. I took out XXXX {$1300.00} in cash and sent the guy a XXXX for that amount. 

Then, trying to arrange for pickup, on XXXX the buyer claimed that his child had gotten into an accident and he could n't buy the furniture anymore. I got extra suspicious, and checking out my Chase balance was alarmed to see that the funds from the original money orders were being reversed. So I know this was all a fraud from the beginning. 

I approached Chase 's fraud department to dispute the withdrawal, since they had cleared the money order funds. They referred me to their customer contract where they state they can "" withdraw any money from my account at any time for any reason '', which i told them was horrible customer service. 

Thus my complaint. Chase Bank must see fraudulent money orders often, and should have protected me a long customer from this by NOT SETTLING FUNDS until they were cleared by XXXX -- like most credit cards would do automatically. I 'm quite upset!! In other words, do n't trust Chase with money orders that "" cleared '' actually means anything.

First was when I set up a payment on an auto insurance company ( XXXX ) on a specific date in which I am 100 % sure I will get enough funds on that day because it 's payday. When XXXX attempted to push thru the payment, the bank denied the payment. XXXX tried twice to get the payment but was denied by Chase, twice. I spoke to several Chase bank specialists and they were all saying that there are no trace of XXXX payment placed on that day. On the other hand, XXXX was claiming they attempted to get the payment twice on that day but was declined by Chase. I was caught in between and Chase did not help me resolve this issue, I ended up paying DMV a lapse of my insurance due to XXXX canceling my auto insurance. XXXX cancelled my insurance because Chase did not provide any proof that I have enough funds in that account. Although my bank statement shows that I did have the funds, but XXXX is not accepting it because they needed a letter head from Chase stating that it was a Bank error. Chase refused to help me with that. I was left unanswered with my confusion that time. A month later, I also have a tuition fee with a huge amount scheduled. I knew I did not have enough funds on the scheduled date and I did not have any opportunity to cancel the scheduled auto-payment since it was done online ( and no options were shown ). I was expecting that Chase would deny that payment since I did not have enough funds in bank, like what happened to the XXXX incident last month. To my surprise, my bank was overdrawn. The payment went thru. I did not understand what 's going on. I called chase again and they can not give me any answers. I had to undergo so many hassle just because of the same situation but with different solutions. Although Chase helped me to stop the payment made, they did not even apologize for this inconvenience. The second frustration i have for Chase was when they closed my account without giving me prior notice. They did not call nor email me with this matter. Today is Monday and also my payday, so I went to go shop for XXXX presents and was embarrassed by the counter upon paying because my debit card was declined. Ofcourse, I double checked my funds and I have {$400.00} available balance to spend. I called chase again and they were saying that my account was closed and they can not undo it because they needed my SSN verification. I opened my account about 5 years ago and they did not require my SSN. It 's very upsetting to return the gifts I was supposed to purchase because I was not informed about closed my checking account. When I spoke to the specialist, she was sarcastic and rude, as if she was annoyed by my inquiries. I totally did not understand why they have to close my account for that reason and without a notice. They said they mailed a notice but I did not receive any. And also, if my account was closed, why did my cheque was deposited to my account and why the teller in the Chase branch did not inform me about my closed account? My Chase mobile app is showing that my account is still active and I can still view my account activities and balance. There are no signs or ways that I can tell that my bank account was closed until I swiped my card. Imagine when I was at a restaurant and I had to pay the food I just ate. This is not fair. My complaint for chase is that they are not consistent and they are misleading their clients. They do not give proper information and notice.

41908,2015-03-19,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Can't repay my loan,Can't decrease my monthly payments,"I am trying to deal with Navient ( formerly XXXX XXXX ) regarding private loans that were taken out for my college tuition ( both under my name and with my mother as the primary borrower and myself as the cosigner. ) They have admitted over the phone repeatedly that if you are n't giving money to them over the phone ( the exact amount that they want, which is exorbitant, ) they will not document the phone call. Because of this, I have started dealing with them only via paper letters, which they have not taken kindly to. 

For the loans where I am the primary borrower, they are expecting well over $ XXXX/month payments which are unreasonable with my income. I have given them multiple financial statements over the phone, which they apparently are n't putting in the system because the next time I talk to someone there they say that there 's nothing on file. When I give them the statements, they agree that $ XXXX/month is too much, but that they have nothing else available. When I ask what they recommend I do, they say to not even bother sending the amount that I can actually afford without losing my home and car ( needed for my job ) because it 's not enough to do anything worthwhile. Then they make fun of me for not going into the career path that I was hoping to while in college and demand to know when I will be. 

For the loans where my mother is the primary borrower, she has one in a lower payment plan. We have confirmation numbers for the payments and they have been taking them out of her checking account, but then we received a letter in the mail stating that the payment plan has been rejected ( no reason why, which we 're trying to find out in writing. ) Yet even after the date the letter was sent, the money has still been taken out of her account by Navient. She 's also still receiving letters and phone calls that that particular account is delinquent, even though she 's making payments on it. 

I am at my wits end with them, trying to contact them via paper ( I refuse to talk to them on the phone anymore, as it 's resulting in me having panic and anxiety attacks every time they call. ) I do n't want to go into default, but I ca n't afford anything close to what they are demanding for these loans. I have used up all of my forbearance time on these loans ( which I paid {$150.00} every few months to put them into when it was XXXX XXXX. ) It 's almost making me wish that I never went to school at all, and also wish that my school had done a better job educating about what private loans really are instead of having me just sign a piece of paper for more money towards tuition ( XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX of XXXX. ) My federal loans are in a reasonable repayment plan based on my income ... why ca n't private loans be the same way?

The phone # is XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX I received an escrow statement from Seterus the statement indicated that my mortgage payment of {$850.00} was increasing to {$1000.00} due to the fact that the escrow was {$1200.00} short and that my town taxes had gone from {$1900.00} to {$3600.00}. I contacted Seterus and told them that my taxes were the same as they have always been and there was no increase. Then asked why they were billing me {$3600.00} for town taxes. They instructed me to call their escrow company XXXX at XXXX. Upon contacting them I told them about the mistake in the town taxes and that the reason why the town levied them for {$3600.00} was because Seterus failed to pay the school taxes of {$1500.00} for the year XX/XX/XXXX. The town XXXX then added that figure to the town taxes of {$1900.00}. They also included interest of {$170.00} which they are holding me liable for.

I contacted them again XX/XX/XXXX and was informed that it would be at least another 30 days to complete their analysis. I explained to them that they were over charging me {$250.00} on my original mortgage payment and they were also charging me the interest on the {$1500.00} from the school taxes that they failed to pay XX/XX/XXXX. The money was escrowed and still is being escrowed I was informed by Seterus that if I did not make the XXXX payment of {$1000.00} it would go against my credit report and that if I paid less than the {$1000.00} they would not apply the payment and I would still be held responsible for the full amount making me late on my mortgage. This is totally unacceptable I am being charged {$250.00} more per month on a mistake they made by not paying the taxes XX/XX/XXXX and my normal mortgage payment of {$850.00} is no longer valid. My town taxes consist of {$1900.00} insurance of {$530.00} and school taxes of {$1500.00} for a total of {$4000.00} instead they are escrowing {$5800.00} a {$1700.00} which is the school taxes plus the interest that they did not pay for XX/XX/XXXX which they are penalizing me for.

47262,2015-06-20,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,,"Hello, On XXXX XXXX, I electronically transferred some money from my Wells Fargo Business account to my Wells Fargo Checking account via my web account. Just so you now, these are linked together online. The reason I made the transfer was to cover a subsequent electronic payment of estimated quarterly tax to the IRS the next day. 
When I logged in to my Wells Fargo accounts online, I discovered that my Checking account was in the red because there was insufficient fund in my Checking account. Payment went out to the IRS the next day as expected, however, money was not transferred from my Business account as I earlier requested online. So, I immediately went ahead to electronically transfer funds from my Business account to my Checking account in order to more than cover the shortfall. I then called Wells Fargo to alert them about this incident. After about 30 minutes on the phone, they confirmed that there was indeed a glitch on their system on XXXX XXXX and/or XXXX. When I asked them why they did not take steps to inform their customers about this, they said this information is only shared with customers who called in to complain. I was surprised by this statement. I further asked them to ensure I am not charged an overdraft fee as they typically do when there is insufficient fund in my Checking account, even if there is sufficient fund in the Business account. This is another issue I 've raised with them on a couple of occasions. However, they claimed I could not automatically link my Business account to the Checking account for overdraft purposes, despite the fact that I was the sole owner of my business and solely operate the Business account. They informed me that I would have to manually make transfers online whenever I expect a shortfall in the Checking account. Anyway, going by to my first issue, I found out on the XXXX of XXXX that I have indeed been charged an overdraft fee for insufficient fund in my Checking account on the XXXX of XXXX, despite the fact that this was entirely Wells Fargo 's fault. I am very inconvenienced by this and would like action taken to ensure this does not occur in future. Thank you for assistance.

2 ) Reward points from this account are, effectively, cash equivalents in that they can be used to offset travel purchases -- airline tickets, hotel expenses, rental cars, for example. 

3 ) I have had this account for over XXXX years. At no point in the past have I ever had to wait over 40 days to have reward points credited to my account. Only recently, after the balance increased substantially, has this issue arisen.

I signed the documents, furnished a lump sum for the remaining payments, and took delivery of the new vehicle and returned my old vehicle the next day. 

At the end of that week, I received a notification that my payment on the previous lease had been taken out of my bank account. I called Ally Financial, explained to a customer service representative that I had returned the vehicle under that lease to the dealer at the beginning of he week, and that I had paid the remaining lease payments as part of my new agreement. After belittling me and telling me that I still owed the payment as well as the remaining lease payments as if I had n't just explained the situation XXXX different ways, the customer service representative told me that I might want to call my dealer because they have no info showing that my lease had been terminated. 

I spoke with the salesman that I had dealt with throughout the lease process, and he told me that the processing might take some time. Now there are XXXX parties pointing fingers at one another. I called back Ally a week later, and spoke to another customer service representative who told me that they had received the remaining lease payments and notification that the lease had been terminated. Good, so how about refunding my extra lease payment? Ally refused to do that. They told me that they would evaluate the situation after the car was sold at auction and decide then whether to refund me the EXTRA payment. Again, they told me to talk to my dealer. 

I left my salesperson a more somber correspondence because at the point I had become more than frustrated. I missed a package delivery from Ally financial later that week, which I expected to be my refund check. I went to the post office today to get the package, and of course it was n't a refund check. Rather, it was a notice of intent to sell my vehicle advising that I order a XXXX party appraisal on the vehicle in case there is a dispute over the value. I see where this is headed. I returned my car with no scratches, dents, or issues with under XXXX miles less than the lease agreement allowed. And I have not been in possession of the vehicle for almost a month so I have no clue how they would expect me to obtain an appraisal at this point. 

Refusing to return an over-payment is n't only unfair, deceptive, and abusive, it 's consumer theft. I have paid every single payment for almost three years on-time and took wonderful care of the vehicle for the duration of the lease. I had considered purchasing the car at the end for the initially agreed on price, because it is probably worth much more than that number given the condition and the lack of miles.

I happened to log-on to the system this evening and noticed that my response was not there. Hence, I am responding now as follows : Macy 's electronic response and their written correspondence dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX fails to answer why Macy 's erroneously reported false information pertaining to my credit report when I applied to the Macy 's credit card. As verified by XXXX, the credit bureau is not responsible for what is reported on my credit report. They only provide the information that is present on the report. As verified by my credit reports that I faxed to CFBP, my credit report reported all XXXX of my accounts as "" PAID AS AGREED '' over the past 8 years. Hence, Macy 's can not blame XXXX for the negative rating that they chose to use to deny a Macy 's XXXX application that I did apply for. This statement is also included in the correspondence that Macy 's sent that clearly states that the credit bureau is not responsible for their adverse decisions. I repeat, I did not apply for a Macy 's American Express card. This is a fact and I do not appreciate Macy 's dishonest statement stating that I did. As indicated, the cashier completed my Macy 's card application via entering my data into her cash register. I did not complete any form and did not leave with any paper work that Macy 's included in their XXXX XXXX, XXXX. If they roll the tape on this date, they will see that what I am saying is a fact.

They did not mention anything about a "" look up '' error. For the record, I did contact Macy 's fraud department to ensure that this would not happen again. Considering that Macy 's is avoiding answering why they reported false derogatory information and blaming XXXX for their unethical conduct, they should be forced to prove what they are saying is correct, as I know for a fact they are lying. The fact that someone else 's email was attached to my credit card and a Macy 's employee charged shoes to my account, Macy 's can not be trusted. The fact that their Executive Office refused to respond to my inquiry regarding why they reported false information regarding my credit report indicates that they are engaging in unethical business practices and lack the integrity to tell the truth about their actions. This was confirmed as well, when their Florida office was determined to respond to this issue via telephone only and tried to avoid responding in writing. I do not appreciate anyone making false statements about my credit history, when my XXXX credit accounts were NEVER LATE and PAID AS AGREED since XXXX up until the time I applied for their account. In contrast, Macy 's reported "" TOO FEW ACCOUNTS CURRENTLY PAID AS AGREED '' and 'SERIOUS DELINQUENCY '', which is a lie.

I call a spade a spade, as I am sick of the lies and corruption that is existing in our society today. There is no rule of law anymore and Macy 's has proven to have zero integrity.

At this time, it was discovered that there was already a credit card account under my social security number XXXX. This was how we first found the fraud. The nice man at XXXX bank was very helpful and we met about 3 more times to resolve the issue. At the time, It was not evident if the identity theft was intentional or if someone had accidently entered my social security number. Regardless, XXXX fixed this in their systems, canceled the other guys credit card, and allowed me to open my XXXX checking account with XXXX under my rightful social security number. When I applied for the credit card, it was understood that I would have to wait a couple months because the "" incident '' put a fraud alert on my credit/social security account. When the time passed, I reached out to all XXXX of the credit agencies ( Experian, XXXX ) to follow up regarding my credit and get my credit report. Little did I know, this was the start of a 3 year battle trying to see that report. 
From that day forward, I have been trying to get help getting my credit report. Getting a HUMAN on the phone with these credit agencies is nearly impossible. Not only are there a plethora of different numbers and departments to call, but every single time you call, you get connected to an automated robot, which then they offer you a long list of Numeral options that are vague and confusing and within each have a web of more options until you reach the end of one and it either A ) HANGS UP or B ) Does not give you any option that fits what you are looking for and you get automatically disconnected or C ) instructs you to "" go online and fill out XXXX form or mail to XXXX address ''. The very rare times that you do get connected to a HUMAN, every single single exact time, the individual has directed me elsewhere ... ..elsewhere meaning the following options : A ) Another ROBOT B ) a website or C ) another person who eventually passes me along as well ( repeat and repeat ... ). 
Now let 's talk about why the website option is not helpful. When I XXXX called to follow up regarding my credit and the fraud with the agencies 3 years ago, that was the XXXX place they directed me to Request my credit report - through the website. So I do that and after putting in all of my information and answering the questions and after I hit "" Submit '' a message of some variation of this would follow : '' We can not identify your account based on the information you provided, please call or mail the following information to this address '' or "" ERROR -- we can not access this page. Please call this number XXXX ''. There is some type of block on my account that does not allow ANYONE to access it within the system. That is why whenever I try to get help online, I am always blocked before getting to the next step because my information appears invalid and then I am directed to call a number. And when I get someone on the phone and they try to help, they always come to a dead end where they can not access any information for me about my account because some type of error pops up that blocks them out. 
I have called each of the agencies countless of times through the years, filled out forms, requests, complaints, mailed in packages of personal information including tax returns, utility bills I pay, my rent bill, a copy of my social security card, my license, passport, XXXX, however I always get the same notice and response -- that they can not identify me and to please send more information or call some other number.

I have two problems with the system currently in place at Citimortgage. 

1. It is reactive rather than proactive. Apparently, the bank will refuse to help unless the customer falls behind and skirts the edge of default ( but paradoxically will not offer a deferment of payment until AFTER the situation has been resolved ). I tried to do the responsible thing and contact them before the issue became a problem of my not being able to pay. 

2.

'' FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( b ) ; XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX S.Ct. XXXX, XXXX. The Congressional findings noted that "" [ t ] here is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with of fairness, impartiality, and respect for the consumer 's right to privacy. '' FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ). However, the credit bureaus do not follow through with any methodology a system that automatically removes an antiquated credit trade line, which leave creditors in control to remove a negative trade line at a later date by simply re-aging the trade line payment history. 
Notice that a positive trade line can be maintained for a ten year timeline from the credit procurement after the account has been closed out. The ten year timeline carries from the date the credit trade line was first reported to a credit reporting agency, or from the date of procurement of the debt. 
I demand the above referenced credit trade line removal based upon the passing of the seven/ten year timeline. And I maintain that there is no further relevancy to the debt being posted under FCRA guidelines. The above-referenced state cases show that the accuracy of credit reporting carries into state court cases as well, whereas a creditor can be brought up on serious civil charges outside of federally protected jurisdictions under FCRA.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NY,12010,Older American,Consent provided,Web,09/11/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1558626

I have attached the detailed FHA HAMP trial agreement to this complaint as well. The trial payment was calculated to be {$2500.00}. Within the same agreement, the letter states my income was calculated to be {$6800.00}. This would leave my housing ratio at 37.68 %. According to the HUD guidelines, this modification program is designing to lower the mortgage payment to 31 % of the monthly gross income. If the payment was calculated to be 31 % of my income, the monthly payment would have been closer to {$2100.00}. According to the HUD underwriting guidelines, the payment should have been calculated as less. The unpaid principal balance on this loan is {$340000.00} plus arrears owed $ XXXX {$400000.00} - 30 % allowable deferment = {$280000.00} over 30 years at 2 % = {$1000.00} + escrows {$1000.00} = {$2100.00}. So my income of {$6700.00} x 31 % = {$2100.00} is just enough to qualify. When we questioned this with the bank, we were told this can be calculated up to 38 % for this program but I do not see those guidelines listed anywhere for FHA HAMP as all that is stated for the target payment is the 31 % and not 38 % for the proposed payment. 
Although I am grateful to have the opportunity to keep my home, this difference in payment would be almost {$450.00} less a month and so much more affordable.

My home is scheduled for foreclosure and I need the Service Provider to provide me an answer as to why they have not assessed my Loan Mitigation Application based on the updated Profit and Loss Statement ( Income ) that was submitted to them. 
Here are specific details of my case. 
1. RCS acknowledged they made a mistake and I appealed their decision to reject the Loan Mitigation Application within 30 days. 
2. The basis of that appeal was the updated Profit and Loss Statement submitted to RCS as part of the appeal letter on XXXX XXXX, 2015. This updated Profit and Loss Statement is included in Exhibit XXXX. The average monthly net profit from the business is {$6400.00} per month ( {$38000.00} divided by 6 months ). When you add my social security income of {$1900.00}, my monthly income adds up to {$8400.00}. This is the monthly income on which RCS needs to assess my Loan Mitigation Application. 
4. The way I have calculated {$8400.00} as my monthly income is exactly the same manner RCS calculated my monthly income earlier based on the preliminary Profit and Loss Statement. This preliminary calculation from RCS is included in Exhibit XXXX. Hence my {$8400.00} is my correct monthly income. 
Therefore, based on the above, RCS needs to assess my Loan Mitigation Application based on the correct updated Profit and Loss Income and my Social Security Income. This amount comes to $ XXXX and not {$7800.00} as claimed by RCS. 
Therefore please ask RCS to read the documents I have mailed them as part of the appeal and to evaluate my Loan Mitigation Application based on the correct monthly income of $ XXXX all the above documents were attached to this Complaint before and are in possession with RCS. They were all submitted as part of the appeal documents mailed on XXXX XXXX, 2015.

I explained that I had no intention of signing up for any such service, and I requested that my account be cancelled and that I receive a refund of the charge. The rep said she would cancel my account, but that she was unable to issue a refund. I then asked to speak to a supervisor. 

After a 20 minute wait on hold, a supervisor named XXXX answered. He told me he would cancel my account but that the fee was non-refundable. He explained that the website was clear in that I had to cancel within 7 days to not be charged. I pointed out that I had no idea I was even enrolled until XX/XX/XXXX when my credit card was charged. I received no email confirmation that I was enrolled in any kind of program, no phone call confirming my enrollment, no customer number or explanation of the program. Nothing. Not until well after the trial period was I even aware of being enrolled. He said I was sent an email on XX/XX/XXXX, which I was, but all that email said was that I had "" updated my account information. '' There was no mention of any service I was signed up for. XXXX reiterated his position that the fee was non-refundable.

I explained that I have never done business online with a company that did n't provide some kind of email confirmation of my purchase. Never. It is clear to me that this is how Experian, and other reporting agencies, sucker people out of money for as long as it takes for them to realize they 'd been swindled by fine print. 

I had a similar problem with XXXX, but at least the rep there refunded the charge. 

I strongly advise anyone wanting to get a copy of their credit report to do it over the phone and very clearly tell the rep that they only want a report and do NOT authorize, under any circumstances, being enrolled in any credit monitoring service. 

Congress needs to take action and stop this kind of railroading from credit reporting agencies. A hacker stole money from my bank account, ilegally. Experian stole money from my credit card legally. But they still stole from me, because I did not intend for them to have my money. And that 's theft, no matter how much fine print they hide behind.

These cases address the obligations of furnishers under federal and state law to supply accurate information, as well as a furnisher 's obligation to "" reinvestigate '' a consumer 's dispute. These cases also indicate that, for the time being at least, a heretofore unrecognized private right of action exists under Civil Code 1785.25 ( g ) and 1785.31 for failure to accurately report credit information in violation of 1785.25 ( a ).

The Original FCRA Legislation Applies To Credit Reporting Agencies OnlyThe Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), found at 15 U.S.C. 1681, et seq., was originally enacted in XXXX. The express purpose of the FCRA was to require that consumer reporting agencies adopt and implement "" reasonable procedures '' for ensuring that credit information about a consumer was collected, maintained, and dispensed "" in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy and proper utilization of such information ...

However, the credit bureaus do not follow through with any methodology a system that automatically removes an antiquated credit trade line, which leave creditors in control to remove a negative trade line at a later date by simply re-aging the trade line payment history. 
Notice that a positive trade line can be maintained for a ten year timeline from the credit procurement after the account has been closed out. The ten year timeline carries from the date the credit trade line was first reported to a credit reporting agency, or from the date of procurement of the debt. 
I demand the above referenced credit trade line removal based upon the passing of the seven/ten year timeline. And I maintain that there is no further relevancy to the debt being posted under FCRA guidelines. The above-referenced state cases show that the accuracy of credit reporting carries into state court cases as well, whereas a creditor can be brought up on serious civil charges outside of federally protected jurisdictions under FCRA.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NY,12010,Older American,Consent provided,Web,09/11/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1558625

I used to make over $ XXXX a year and now I am making half that. My husband XXXX, so he could not work for many months. We have had to borrow money from family and borrow from our retirement just to make ends meet. I believe that Wells Fargo illegally denied me for the assistance and since I 've read that they have been fined heavily for wrong doing, I was forced to hire a law firm to protect my home. I would have never gotten in this mess had Wells Fargo not told me to get behind on my payments. They told me it was necessary to be able to qualify for the hardship assistance. Then they played games with me. They told me they never received my paperwork even though I faxed it to them multiple times. Even when I got them to admit that they received the paperwork, they said they lost it and told me I had to re-apply. They kept changing relationship managers on me and I could never get the same person on the phone twice. My mortgage is currently 55 % of my gross monthly income. If that is not considered a hardship by Wells Fargo, then what is? I believe I meet every single criteria put forth by the HAMP program. My mortgage was originated in 2003 and I never refi 'd after that. I am hoping that someone will hold these big banks accountable for denying homeowners assistance when they clearly deserve it. I think the main reason that Wells Fargo is not helping me is because I have some positive equity and they want to get that money for themselves. I did not read anything on the HAMP guidelines that if a homeowner has positive equity that the lender does not have to approve them for HAMP, but maybe that is just the banks ' policy to maximize their profits.

2. There was no new appraisal to calculate LTV ratio during loan modification. 
3. They are NOT using the original appraisal value to calculate LTV ratio to remove PMI.

I found out reason, and ask the team to fix the mistake. Finally, commitment was issued. Shall I blame myself since I lost the commitment contingency? 

The real nightmare started from that moment. The underwriter kept asking for new stuff on the daily basis. I tried my best to cooperate and handed over the files mostly in 2 hours.

On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I went to XXXX XXXX. While I was at the store, I asked the salesperson, XXXX, if I had any credit history and could purchase furniture on credit. The salesperson asked for my social security number so he could check my credit history and see if I was eligible for a loan. 
The salesperson told me I could borrow up to {$3500.00}. I wanted to buy a mattress, but he said I should buy a more expensive item so I could improve my credit. I found a cabinet set I liked and said I would consider purchasing it. The salesperson told me it would cost {$1700.00} including delivery. He then took down my information on a laptop, and said I needed to sign an agreement authorizing the lending company to send me emails. I complied with his requests. 
I then told the salesperson that before making a decision on the set, I needed to check to see if the cabinet would fit in my living room and wanted to wait until I received by benefits check on XXXX XXXX. The salesperson said that was okay, and provided me a receipt, which I understood to be an offer to sell me the cabinet. I never signed the receipt, and did not pay any money to the salesperson. At no time was I told or did I believe that I had committed to taking out a loan or purchasing the furniture. 
When I went home, I realized that the cabinet would not fit in my house. I also received an email from Bristlecone Lending attaching a document saying the set would cost me around {$250.00} in monthly payments, and I realized that I could not afford this amount. Because I did not agree to any loan or lease agreement in the store, I did not think the document I received was a completed lease or loan. 
I immediately called the store and told the salesperson I did not want the cabinet. The salesperson told me that I had to buy the set, and said I would have to pay a cancellation fee of {$390.00} if I cancelled. When I told him I did not think I should have to pay a fee and I could not afford a fee, the salesperson told me there was nothing he could do to help and I needed to speak with the owner, his father. I went to speak to the owner in person, but he told me that I needed to talk to the salesperson, who was not there. The next week I again went to the store : The salesperson again said I could not cancel, but told me I could exchange the cabinet for other items of the same price. He also said I could pay as little as {$50.00} a month, so long as I continued to pay. I again said that I had not agreed to purchase anything and could not afford any payments. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2015, Bristlecone called me. The woman who called me said that I needed to make payments to Bristlecone, and that if I wanted to cancel the loan, I would have to pay certain fees. I explained to Bristlecone that the loan was obtained through fraud, that I never received any furniture from XXXX XXXX, and that I do not owe Bristlecone any money. Over the last week, I have continued to receive phone calls from Bristlecone seeking to collect debt. 
I am a single mother of XXXX children whose only income is public assistance, and I am XXXX due to XXXX. Disputing this fraud has caused me a lot of emotional distress. 
I am reporting this situation because Bristlecone is lending in New York without a license from the New York Department of Financial Services. N.Y. Banking Law 340. Further, Bristlecone has inadequate policies to prevent the issuance of fraudulent loans. Finally, Bristlecone is now calling me as many as XXXX times a day, which is harassing.

I had contacted XXXX on a repayment again but was then notified by GreenTree at the end of XX/XX/XXXX that they were now servicing the mortgage. 
The XXXX XXXX payment was made at a XXXX branch location, but GreenTree claimed to not have received the payment. 
My experience with GreenTree from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX was very difficult. I had faxed proof of the XX/XX/XXXX payment to GreenTree on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Conversation with the service reps was not helpful ( my account manager was very rude and said that I could not speak to anyone but her ). I explained the hardships that were occurring but they did not offer a viable solution such as a re payment plan, or information on a loan modification. 
I was also never notified by Ditech whether the XX/XX/XXXX payment to XXXX was credited to my loan. 
During all of this time I consistently sent my full monthly payments EVERY month via Overnight Express Mail with USPS. I have all of the receipts for all payments sent. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I received a notification from Ditech that they were now servicing my mortgage, I was given a representative for my account. I began calling the number and relevant extension but never received a call back. I have left my cell number every time.

On XXXX/XXXX/15 I called Capital One 360 to verify their receipt of the transfer form. They verified having received the transfer form and informed me it was signed, approved, and mailed to Capital One on XXXX/XXXX/15. 

On XXXX/XXXX/15 I called Capital One to see if they received the paper work from Capital One 360. 
I was informed they did not receive it and that the transfer form should have been mailed to Capital One not Capital One 360.

At this point I requested to talk to a supervisor at both divisions.

At the end of the process I went to pay and it said the address was wrong, I tried again, still said it was wrong. That was the correct address for my card, so I went back and put "" n/a '' in the apartment field just in case that 's what I had put- and then it said that there were insufficient funds in my bank account. 

The order had not gone through, I went to my bank account, and I saw that the charges had been sent through and were pending on my bank account- putting a hold on that money. 

I called the cell company to ask for XXXX charge to be dropped and if my order could be pushed through on the other charge. They said no. I asked if they could reverse the charges, because I could n't afford the hold on both- they said no- to call my bank and have them cancel it. 

First woman I talked to with my bank said that they could n't do it without a phone company rep approving cancelling the charges, and that I might be held accountable for any overage charges that resulted. She said if they did that, I would have instant access to my money- which I needed because I had no cash on hand, and my stove is broke, so that 's what would feed me until payday. 

Called the phone company again and asked that rep if he could talk to my bank and approve the charges being dropped. The plan was drop both charges, go into the store and do it in person, and then I 'd have about XXXX bucks until payday. 

We call the bank, and we explained the situation ... that XXXX charges were pending on my account, I could n't afford that, the order did not go through, I was n't going to get anything for the money, and to please just delete the pending charges. 

The bank wanted confirmation numbers from the phone company. The phone company had said nothing had been generated on their side because the sale did not go through. I said I had some sort of confirmation numbers on my transaction report for the XXXX charges of XXXX, and the bank rep said that it could n't come from me. 

I told them all I had was XXXX and change in my account with the hold until Friday, that I had no food and would be forced to withdraw the XXXX in order to eat. ( which left me with XXXX cents in my account ). I said that this was n't my fault- the phone company 's site glitched and now, even with the phone company saying to release my funds, I 'm going to end up going negative and getting fees on my account because of it. 

This bank person said that I "" probably '' would n't be held accountable for the fees, but refused to guarentee it. He also said that the hold would last a few days, where either it will time out in the system, or the money will withdraw and I would have to go through the process of fighting it. 

The phone company guy tried again to explain that I was in need of the new service, and in need of my money- that he was giving permission to cancel the transaction according to what the woman said in the morning, and the bank person refused. I spoke on the phone from someone here asking for advice, they could n't find rules that fit my situation, so they passed it on to the FAQ people, and mentioned the possibility of a complaint.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,NY,11204,,Consent provided,Web,10/19/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1608316

I understand that my personal finances are my own responsibility, but when there are temporary lapses in funding, Chase ( and most other banks ) will charge and overdraft fee almost immediately. In many cases, this amounts to a 1700 % interest rate on an informal 'microloan '. 
For example, I recently set up an automatic payment for a credit card. I had transferred money to XXXX account ( I keep them separate to manage funds ) and because the transfer had not yet processed, and the CC pulled their payment ( ACH ) from my Chase account, there was a {$34.00} overdraft charge.

We tried to respond to Wells Fargo 's response to above complaint - but could not at this CFPB website, we could not find the way to do this at this CFPB website. -- Our new complaint below - related to our prior complaint and answering Wells Fargo 's response ( number above ) follows here : Wachovia Bank, who the loan was originated with, failed to comply withtheir agreement and terms of this loan. XXXX we accepted a purchase order from XXXX of our customers and needed to access the {$7000.00} available in our line of credit. To our surprise, Wachovia Bank, without notifying to us, cut back our {$250000.00} line of credit to {$240000.00} -- without notifying us. 

The document for this loan clearly indicates that they would notify us if theyever cut back our loan, they did not. 
When we asked Wachovia, for the reason they had cut back the loan, theydid not have a reason and came up with several different reasons, including:1-not enough equity in our property, used for collateral for the loan. This was, and is, an inaccurate statement. 
2-The bank accused us of cashing a {$7000.00} check against this loan. When we asked to provide a copy of this "" check '' they could not provide it as this never occurred. 
3-The business credit and financial trade lines were past due, this was totallyinaccurate, as a matter of fact, our credit line was never past due with Wachovia Bank, ever. 

*Please note that all of the representatives that we attempted to resolve thisissue with we 're completely baffled as well - as to why the line would be cut back, and promised they would reinstate it, after many attempts they never did. 
In the meantime, we were unable to fullfill our small businesses orders, which set back ourbusiness considerably in XXXX and ensuing years. We have had to lay off all our employees and we are working very hard to recover from this cut in our available credit and the ensuing treatment by Wachovia and Wells Fargo - all tracedto Wachovia 's reneging on the terms of their agreement with us, then an ever-changing story every time we tried to correct the situation - after many offers to correct it on their part. 

*After filing a complaint with Wells Fargo , who has since taken over WachoviaBank , they responded with inaccuracies, including claiming a letter was sent to us in XXXX alerting us that the loan had been restricted and our credit abruptly cut. 
There was no possible way we would have received this letter as the address on the letter was RECREATED - with a NEW ADDRESS WE WERE NOT LOCATED AT WHEN WELLS FARGO CLAIM THEY SENT THIS LETTER TO US! When brought up to Wells Fargo they recently responded that this was a "" recreation '' of a letter sent by Wachovia. WE ASK : Why would a letter need to be recreated if they could just pull a copy from their file - just as it was sent?? 
This letter was sent only this year, XXXX, we believe was fabricated as we never could have received this letter in the first place. Please see attached copy. 
Please note, even if we had received this letter as they allege, the reasonsprovided for the reduction of the line of credit did not comply with Wachovia'sreasons for doing so, according to page XXXX of the section marked "" suspensionand/or reduction of credit limit '' as non of the reasons listed pertained to our business. 

Therefore, due to Wachovia 's total disregard for the terms of their document, their false claim of "" informing us '', as well as the subsequent mishandling of this line of credit, which has resulted in an almost total demise of our business, we request 100 % forgiveness for this line of credit.

Note : Hudson City does not fall under the US HARP program. During this time, Hudson City would not lower our mortgage interest rate despite numerous attempts to work with them. We also requested help from other financial institutions, but as we were current on our mortgage we could not qualify. Due to this situation, we could not be current on both our taxes and our mortgage. Over the course of a few years, we regained stable employment and our incomes have increased and however, Hudson City rolled our back taxes into our mortgage and rendered the monthly mortgage payment impossible to pay, despite the fact that we can now pay our taxes plus mortgage and a small portion of our back taxes. With new funds now coming in and increased salaries, we can make it work, but not under this new monthly payment. We attempted to send our mortgage payment + taxes into Hudson City, and they refused to accept this payment as they deemed it partial. Our actual mortgage was {$2200.00} our taxes appx {$900.00}, our check was for {$3300.00}. We are desperate for a resolution, be it rolling the back taxes into the final sale of the house, lowering the interest rate of the mortgage, or longer terms ... every time we discuss this with Hudson City Bank, each person states that it is not their department.

This amount was debited each month and I never received any information from Care Credit that there was a problem. 

In XXXX 2015 ( 6 months later ), I received a letter and statement from Care Credit showing that I now owed around {$370.00}. Completely baffled, I read over the statement and saw that they had been charging me fees of {$40.00} - {$50.00} each month without my knowledge. Since the beginning of 2015, I have been charged nearly {$400.00} in these fees ( more than my initial debt which was a XXXX time use of the card for {$300.00} at the dentist ).

Manager was absolutely unprofessional and asked why I missed the payments. My explanation was not enough. 
2nd call - to XXXX on the statement and spoke to a rep. ( with a strong accent ) she apologized and said I should not have been reported and connected me to credit division.

The service provider must state that the invoice will not go into a collection status until the 30-day timeline has been completed, and a specified date must be given to the consumer. A service provider can not submit a medical invoice to a licensed debt collector until after the 30-day timeline has been completed, without exception. 
If the 30-day time has passed, the service provider can at that time turn over the invoice to a licensed debt collector in the consumer 's residency state. 
The debt collector must submit a written notice of collection, stating that the consumer has 180 days to either rectify the debt personally, settle the debt amicably, or to expedite that an insurance carrier will pay the medical claim. The debt can not be posted on a credit bureau for collection until the 180-day timeline has passed, also without exception. 
I hereby state that the attached medical collection is now illegal, and that the new collection guidelines for medical debts are applied to existing collections.

- I had a line of credit attached to the account that had to be closed, and was denied application for the same line of credit on my new account. 
- XXXX month after closing my account and being sure that all my automatic payments, etc., had been updated, I went to a Citibank branch to close the account. 
- I explicitly asked if my ability to repay the balance on the line of credit would be affected, and was told, definitively, "" No, it would not. "" - The automatic payments that I had setup in those XXXX months from new account stopped processing because the line of credit was closed. 
- When I realized, I called the bank and tried to setup automatic payments again. I was told that they were setup, and I had a XXXX late fees taken back by the bank. 
- Months later, I got a notice stating that I had missed XXXX payments in a row ( did not receive intermittent letters before then ) ; I had n't noticed because ( 1 ) I was told that automatic payments had been setup, and ( 2 ) I no longer have access to the account online so could not check to see if payments were being made, and ( 3 ) did not get a notice from the bank until XXXX payments were missed. I tried to have these late payments taken back, but was denied. 
- It was at this time that I spoke to the collections dept, and was able to negotiate an agreement whereby I made XXXX specific monthly payments that we set up on the spot, and then I would have my account brought back to current, and then I could go about making regular payments again. 
- While paying the debt-collection payments setup by the bank over the phone, i continued to receive late payment charges, even though I was paying EXACTLY according to the plan they setup ( there was literally no other option without me calling to cancel, which did not happen ). 
- Tried to get those late charges taken back, and was denied, despite the fact that it was clearly the bank 's fault. 

This has affected the amount of interest I 'm being charged, my overall balance due to late fees, and my credit score. I would sincerely like to change banks, but the switching costs are prohibitive due to my affected credit score, and my worry that I will not be able to make payments on the closed account with a non-Citibank account.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NY,11238,,Consent provided,Web,06/25/15,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,1438323

The application has taken approximately 1-year to process, and Ocwen has since been close to impossible to contact regarding the matter. They are constantly assigning new people to my case, which is making it more difficult to get things resolved. 

Additionally, my automatic payment option to pay for my mortgage has been turned off by Ocwen two times. Several attempts, on my part, have been made to submit the necessary paperwork to get the automatic payments set up again, but they have not been able to successfully reinstate it. Since this has happened, Ocwen has claimed that my loan is past due, however, my bank statements show that Ocwen has pulled the payment amount from my checking account ( where is the money going? ). My mortgage is approximately $ XXXX/month, but Ocwen has sent me several, certified letters claiming that I owe close to {$17000.00} for 3 months in arrears ( 3-months multiplied by {$2300.00} is {$6900.00} ). Their letters have claimed that I am in danger of losing my home. 

As a senior, and widower, I have been on a fixed income for several years, and have always paid my mortgage on-time ( my credit score is consistently in the XXXX FICO range ). I do n't have any understanding as to why my payment plan has been altered by Ocwen, and I am frustrated with the fact that Ocwen has made no attempt to help me get my payment plan activated.

They took over my mortgage servicing in XXXX 2015, before I even got an invitation/introductory letter informing me about that they already served me with a bill demanding payment, while my old servicing company collected payment already from my account ( which was eventually returned ). 
And from then on it 's never ending harassment. I am bombarded with letters asking for all kinds of building insurances/policies, things I have never been asked for during 27 years I have been living here and owning the coop. Letters treating to buy insurance FOR THE BUILDING ON MY BEHALF! 
On one occasion they suggested that if insurance policies are not received they will buy some {$8000.00} property insurance and I will be charged for that PREMIUM. Another letter was sent to me stating that I will be charged premium of {$1400.00} for some other insurance policy. It 's just never ending game. 
I have called multiple times and explained that I have in all 27 years none of the banks or previous mortgage servicing companies asked me for any insurance policies. 
I have given SETERUS building management telephone number, fax number and Managers name so they can obtain all and any insurance policies they need, but they never contacted them. 
I had building management call SETERUS asking what it that they exactly need is, but STERUS refused to talk to them and said that they will not discuss it with third party. That THIRD PARTY owns this property/ residential building and that third party has insurance brokers that handle all insurance policies, but they would not talk to them. Every few weeks I would get another letter asking for another insurance policy, or stating that that policy expired and they will charge me for the one they will buy on my behalf. 
They had a nerve to charge me with {$1400.00} escrow balance added to my mortgage statement! 
Only when I called asking what 's that for and why they did it, they stated that it was just removed! 
They basically do whatever they want and play with my mortgage.

The following day, the payment had n't gone thru and the balance accrued another {$0.00} in interest. I spoke to XXXX at First Niagara who advised that the payment takes 48 hours to show but when the payment goes thru it will back date any accrued interest thus wiping them off the balance. Once the payment of {$27.00} finally went thru on XXXX/XXXX/15 the additional interest ( which grew to {$0.00} ) was not wiped off as I was initially promised. I spoke to XXXX again who advised that what he had told me initially was not true and that loan would still accrue interest and payments that take 48 hours to process do not get back dated to the date of the original payment and he refused to remove the additional interest even though he admitted his mistake. He assured me though that the balance would not accrue any further interest so I went ahead and paid the {$0.00} balance. Again, when the payment was processed 48 hours later, there balance had indeed accrued another {$0.00} in interest on XXXX/XXXX/15. That same day I spoke to XXXX at First Niagara who attempted to credit my account the {$0.00} retroactive to the original balance date of XXXX/XXXX/15 which she had done.

I called again and this time spoke to Georgia, who tied to tell me that the interest was accruing because I used the card.

She did not have an explanation for this and stated that she would also credit my account the {$0.00} of interest.

90755,2015-08-17,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"I purchased my house in XX/XX/XXXX and entered into a mortgage contract with a specific mortgage lender. In XX/XX/XXXX I realized I would soon have a problem paying the mortgage due to my upcoming unexpected retirement and divorce. At that time a new bank ( Wells Fargo ) was now servicing my mortgage. 

I called Wells Fargo prior to my retirement to discuss what options I would have to reduce my monthly mortgage payments. I was up to date on all payments at that time. Wells Fargo told me ( via phone with a mortgage counselor ) that there was nothing I could do at that time and that I should call them back once I am unable to make the monthly payments. 

Once I went into owing a couple of months arrears for missed payments, I was able to apply for a mortgage modification. The process of submitting acceptable documentation and review took about 6 months before receiving a definitive answer to the modification. The answer to my modification application was that, unknown to me, my mortgage was of a type that could not be modified. At that point I was about 9 months in arrears and no longer eligible for other types of mortgage relief. 

Despite being told that my mortgage could not be modified, I was allowed to reapply twice for a modification under different programs or new income guidelines. Wells Fargo also offered me a modification, but it was no where near the reduction that would allow me to stay in the house within my now fixed income. 

Had I known that my mortgage could not be modified before going into arrears I could have pursued a number of options that would have satisfied the mortgage and maintained my excellent credit rating. Because of the lack of knowledge of this key piece of information, I have been locked into a "" Catch-XXXX '' situation with no good resolution possible for either party. 

My complaints about the mortgage servicing process by Wells Fargo are:1. Although I was notified about the change of mortgage servicer, I was never notified about a change in my ability to modify the mortgage. 
2. Their refusal to discus, prior to a payment problem existing, my ability to modify my mortgage. 
3. Their contradictory response of telling me my mortgage could not be modified, and then offering me a voluntary modification. My refusal of an inadequate modification was also used as evidence of my not accepting help that was offered. 
4. Once the modification process started I was never offered any other relief that might address my situation. I was thus placed in a financial situation, which they would be aware of, where there was no relief available. 
5. Having me apply for a modification that "" can not be modified '' is a waste of everyone 's valuable time. Allowing me to apply multiple times is cruel and unethical. 
6. The lack of prior notice of modification status and lack of clear and timely communication contradicts Wells Fargo 's efforts toward "" home preservation ''. The consumer was placed, through no fault of his own, in an inevitable financially-debilitating situation with long-term consequences that could have easily been avoided.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NY,10567,Older American,Consent provided,Web,08/17/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1522471

On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I electronically signed into USAA to cash out the CD and pay the balance of the secured loan.

Naturally, I called USAA and informed representatives of the situation, and I made the following requests : 1. I asked that USAA please RETURN the {$9500.00} they had TAKEN from my checking account and applied to the loan. USAA representatives could not ( or would not ) reverse the charge. 
2. I then requested my CD funds be released and deposited into my checking account as to cover the overdrawn funds. USAA representatives could not ( or would not ) provide me access to my CD account or money in the account, although the CD had matured that day.

I was told by customer service that according to their ledger I had enough money in my account to cash the check to transfer my money to another account for my mortgage payment. 
Chase has always been good to me and reimburses the OD FEES, but they limit their customers to XXXX in a one year period, My complaint is not against the bank nor the merchant, it is the procedure that I feel needs a look at. 
My other bank, a credit union, does not alter the usable number, all transactions are withheld from my account and the ledger shows a greater total but a lesser usable amount especially if the merchant enters the transaction as charge and not a debit ; my total amount and usable amount even up when all transactions have actually been paid ; this is the fair/upfront way of managing the accounts of the customers.

They then asked me to stay on with their company, in exchange for a retention offer, which they promised to put bonus points on my account, after some different charges I will put on my account. so I stayed on with them. However, I soon realized this was a gimmick, and they did n't even give me the chance to do so. it was just for them ; to be able to suddenly close it without notice, instead of me doing it, so to be able to steal my rewards, and to get it reported on my credit report as closed by credit granter, resulting in a significant decrease to my credit score. Also they charged me interest on a balance transfer after assuring me I wo n't be charged. When I questioned them as to why they decided to grant my request to close it..? their answer was : 1 ) since I drastically went over my credit limit, 2 ) had three returned payments, 3 ) opened to many accounts past year. To Clarify : 1 ) This is odd even if I would 've not have paid, as with every other bank either they do n't allow you to overcharge, or it 's no issue, especially weird of course after I paid almost full balance. And even more strangely upsetting after advising them that these charges were made without my consent. 2 ) Explaining them issue with returned payments, furthermore, In the past they also once in error stopped a check sent to me causing me damage and bad image. 3 ) I had no problem while starting the relationship with them, although I always had many accounts. 4 ) In addition to the above referenced account, all other accounts including my wife 's, were closed, even where no issue occurred at all. All this happened only after I warned them I 'll report them to the CFPB, and start litigation against them, since they were refusing to send a mid cycle update to the credit reporting bureau about a very large payment I made on my spouses account, right after the statement closed with a high balance, saying they do n't do this service, no matter damages causing you, which is ruining my score as well, being that I am an AU on the account. Despite the fact, that they did update right away the closure of my account done by them, even though it was still open on the closing date of the statement. They are not acting in good faith as every other bank would 've done to send an update to the bureau, even after I advised them of the damage it 's causing to my report having a large balance. They are also refusing to rectify the reporting as closed by consumer. I had a very big lost by using their cards above other companies, especially that they are not allowing me to redeem my rewards I legally earned by using the card and paying for it.

When I retrieved my credit report, I found out that for some miraculous reason, both my sisters SSNs were linked to my report. In addition, my birthdate apparently is XXXX, when in fact, is XXXX. Unless I 'm mistaken, I would 've thought that an individual is tied to XXXX single SSN, and not XXXX additional SSNs. This unfortunate situation has led me to appear to be responsible for all credit-related accounts that are not mine, including student loans, a delinquent credit card account, and credit inquiries that I never made. In addition, because all of our names have beginning syllables that are identical, that makes it such that I am the same person as my sisters.

Making a new deal which I had to did before to get a vehicle now I 'm in the process to reach and hold a TLC driver license and license plates and insurance that will takes more than 60 days to be effective if lucky. 

But also, the vehicle will stays outside of the appropriate ran. ge to produce the expected incomes average, because the color and interior materials do n't matches with the regulations for the convenience of the new license and plates. 


What I 'm asking to your office? 

-To speak with the money provider ( Exeter XXXX to extend the credit to more than the 4 years now signed. Hopefully 7 years, In order to lower the monthly amount. 

Or and preferable, To transform the buying contract that I signed for a lease contract which will benefit me lowering the monthly cost and making possible to paid the vehicle without the actual risk to lost it. 

To ask to the dealer to replace the vehicle for some similar value and usage, even in a different brand from the same cars factory which can be a XXXX or XXXX with the appropriate characteristics of color and interior finish to complete with regulations for the for hire passengers industry in XXXX however must be same price to cover the Bank or Exeter financial institution with the real value of the title possession. 

I can not imagine how could be the future if I do not take any action right away. The worst scenario will be to lost the vehicle for the Bank Exeter reposition and to keep paying the difference remaining from a deal they will make with the now used or second hand vehicle with XXXX miles now it have. 

It will to stay paying about {$15.00} for the next 4 years without vehicle and incomes from the benefit of it. 

So, your help is extremely important for the mistake I did due to my own ignorance about small rules which are the main, means basically they wrong selection of vehicle that I did made because, size, color and interior color for the next step as a TLC NY vehicle where the XXXX do n't qualify for black car service and the incomes will never compensate this wrong effort that I did took for my family and myself.

This complaint is in regard to a Home Equity Line of Credit ( "" HELOC '' ) and is supported by a sworn affidavit based on firsthand personal knowledge. Affiant has written several inquiries in the form of Qualified Written Requests ( "" QWRs ) to Chase ( JPMCB ) in an effort to ascertain information about the subject HELOC without success ( Attachment A ). Letters sent to Chase asking pertinent details were not answered in full as required by RESPA 12 USC 2605 -e. 

The public record and copies of certain documents received from Chase ( JPMCB ) in response to requests reveal that fraudulent activity has taken place throughout the transaction, from the beginning, and that fraudulent activity continues to the present day. 
In violation of RESPA, Chase failed to respond to QWR inquiries into the relevance and significance of XXXX different account numbers associated with the Home Equity Line of Credit ; Chase failed to respond to QWR inquiries into 'Accounting and servicing systems ' stating, "" This information is proprietary and will not be provided. "" ; Chase failed to fully respond to QWR inquiries into 'Debits and credits ' stating, "" Some of this information is either proprietary or unavailable, and will not be provided. "" ; Chase failed to fully respond to QWR 'Servicing-related questions ', stating, in part, "" Any assignment of the Security Instrument, previous sellers, purchasers, assignors, and assignees would be a matter of public record. Please review public record for this information. "" ; and, "" Some of the information requested under this section is either proprietary or unavailable, and will not be provided. "" ; Chase failed to respond simple "" yes '' or "" no '' questions in QWR dated XX/XX/XXXX. 
There is evidence that the original Loan Application contained figures falsified by Chase - not by the Applicants - representing amounts which greatly overstated Applicant ( s ) true monthly income under each of the XXXX the sections captioned "" Gross Income '' for the Applicant ( s ). 
We allege that the original application was altered by parties employed or authorized by Chase without Applicants ' knowledge or permission in order to monetize and/or securitize the line of credit. 
It is our position that the alterations were made with the intent of increasing the value of the application and/or related documents to Chase for use in subsequent JPMCB deals, transactions, sales, conversions, contracts, and other schemes to benefit JPMCB. 
In addition, unbeknownst to Applicant ( s ), JPMCB converted or otherwise misused Applicant ( s ) personal information and data on the application, along with the other documents/and credit agreements Applicants were induced to sign, to create other type ( s ) of financial instrument ( s ) and/or securities. 
Applicants did not sign a Note. It is our position that JPMCB ( Chase ), in fraudulently creating said Note ( s ), engaged in Identity Theft of Affiant 's personal identifying information in violation of the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of XX/XX/XXXX ( "" the Act '' ), 18 USC 1028, making it a felony to knowingly transfer without lawful authority a means of identification of another person with the intent to commit ... or aid and abet any unlawful activity. 
Further, Affiant alleges that Chase is pursuing a foreclosure action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York , County of XXXX, which is unwarranted and that Chase has come to the court with unclean hands : The mortgage transaction is void.

This XXXX incident has resulted in me beginning procedures to close all of my BOA accounts, not just my credit card. On XXXX XXXX I had great difficulty ordering a product on-line using my BOA credit card. After several failed attempts to pay with my card I called BOA. They told me that their fraud detection capabilities flagged my card and they would need to validate my attempted purchase before allowing it to go through. I was shocked, since I was actually using BOAs 'ShopSafe ' capability which should clearly indicate to even the most primitive software that it could not be fraudulent activity. Also disturbing, was that after each attempt to authorize payment I would receive an alert on my mobile device indicating a successful payment. After working with customer service we were able to authorize the purchase. I was actually able to see the purchase as a pending transaction on the BOA website. Unfortunately, after nearly XXXX, the pending status never changed, and there was no shipment notification from the merchant. I actually called the merchant inquiring as to why they were not shipping my item. They informed me that they have been trying to finalize the authorization with BOA, but failed each time. On XXXX XXXX I set up a conference call with BOA and the merchant. We tried repeatedly to remove the totally erroneous 'fraud detection block ' but to no avail. During these attempts, the pending status of my earlier attempt disappeared! In the end, I needed to hang up with the BOA associate and complete my purchase with an American Express card. The associate on the phone indicated that because I bought a juice in XXXX during the morning, but was attempting to make a web purchase with a company in Minnesota in the afternoon, I likely caused a fraud alert to lock my card! 
There are XXXX upsetting aspects to this : The XXXX is that BOAs credit card software is disjointed, primitive, and functional only if all variables and circumstances are pristine. Even the slightest digression from a normal credit card event ( like an XXXX resident buying a juice in the morning and then using the internet to order an item out of state ) causes their systems to fail. XXXX, none ( none! ) of the other credit cards I own have ever cancelled themselves without notice ( my previous complaint to cfpb ) or blocked my card so thoroughly that even the issuing agency could not unlock it! This indicates that BOA has chosen to allow the client experience to suffer immeasurably rather than absorb unfortunate, but normal losses from credit card fraud. I can not be the only customer being inconvenienced.

Not only my mortgage company did not try to help me get back my stolen co-op, but it conspired with thieves to illegal sell stolen co-op, cover-up crimes committed against me by claiming theft of my co-op was legal, damage my reputation by stating that owe for maintenance, destroy my credit rating by reporting my mortgage payment late for over 30 months and judgment for not paying its credit card, and now on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, trying to claim all of the tainted proceeds from illegal sale of my stolen co-op to pay-off the mortgage -- knowing that I did not know or authorize the sale of my stolen co-op on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, by co-op management based on a judgment and warrant that never existed.

Amex acted in concert with the co-op management to deprive me of my co-op and cover-up crimes committed against me by doing nothing to help me get back my co-op, destroying my means to earning an income by damaging my credit, not informing Fannie Mae that I stopped paying my mortgage after I lost co-op possession on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, not putting me in foreclosure, making no effort to collect on the mortgage, allowing my stolen co-op to be illegally sold on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, continuing to report my mortgage late on my credit report as of XXXX XXXX, waiting for co-op management to notifying me in letter dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, about the illegal sale of my stolen co-op on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and {$100000.00} escrowed proceeds in NJ XXXX XXXX XXXX for case XXXX, and putting in a Motion on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, for case NJ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX lawsuit which is not a party to claim the entire {$100000.00} ( approx. over {$19000.00} more than my mortgage amount ) to circumvent the law, violate my due process rights and void mortgage foreclosure laws ( Exhibits B and C ).

103755,2015-03-26,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"My co-op loan was originally made with XXXX XXXX Bank, and is now held by JP Morgan Chase. 

My payment due date is the XXXX day of the month, but I have a 15 day grace period and can pay by the XXXX of the month without a late fee. Historically, if the XXXX fell on a weekend or holiday, I was allowed to pay on the following business day without penalty. 

I have recently been making payments online through the Chase website. I had a problem where I was charged a late fee for the XXXX XXXX payment. Since XXXX/XXXX/XXXX was on a Saturday, I scheduled the payment for the following Monday, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. The bank 's mortgage department is run incompetently. They issue late fees on the XXXX even if a payment is scheduled in their system for that day. Once the payment is processed and they realize it was paid on time, the late fee is removed. 

I thought that the bank made an error and mistakenly failed to remove the late fee. I called several months ago and was told that the fee would be removed. I thought they removed it and made the same mistake again and charged me another late fee. When I called on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to inquire, I spoke to XXXX XXXX XXXX working in XXXX, LA. She informed me that this was the late fee from the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX payment, and it was n't removed. 

XXXX XXXX explained that the late fee was valid, saying that their payment processing center is open on Saturdays, and that if the XXXX falls on a Saturday and they have n't received payment by that date, they charge a late fee. She said that the grace period is extended only when the XXXX is on a Sunday ( and presumably bank holidays as well ), because their office is closed. 

I checked my loan agreement, and it did not mention additional grace period days when the grace period is not on a business day. But I think what Chase did was improper, for the following reasons:1 ) This was a change in policy. I do n't know if the policy was in effect when Chase took over my loan in XXXX XXXX, or if they changed it sometime after that. But I do know that for my loan, the policy changed, and I was not notified of this change. Without written notice, the policy change should not apply. I had no way of knowing about the change. 

2 ) While their payment processing center may be open on Saturdays, I 've been paying my bills on their website, and they do not accept payments on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. If permitted, I will attach or email screenshots showing that it is not possible to select a Saturday as a payment date. 

3 ) I suspect that allowing a longer grace period on days that the bank does not accept payments is done for legal reasons, not because the bank is nice. Perhaps having a processing center open to receive mail fulfills this requirement, but most people do n't pay their bills by mail anymore. For all I know, they could have a tiny office with a single employee, just to take in the mail, for the sole purpose of scamming people and charging them late fees when they do n't pay until the following Monday. 

4 ) There are no rules explaining this policy on the website. It says that payment must be received within 15 days of the due date. But on the website, I ca n't schedule a payment on either Saturday or Sunday. How am I supposed to know that if the XXXX is on a Sunday, I can pay on the XXXX, but if it is on a Saturday, I have to pay on the XXXX? There is nothing that says anything about this. Why does n't Chase allow me to schedule a payment on a Saturday if they process payments on Saturdays as they claim? The only answer is that they are running a scam to charge late fees to unsuspecting customers who think that the grace period is extended to Monday because the system does n't accept a Saturday payment. 

Please force Chase to rectify the situation for all customers. XXXX XXXX said that my late fee was waived as a courtesy, but I paid on time.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,NY,110XX,,Consent provided,Web,03/26/15,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,Yes,1302054

104202,2015-11-13,Credit reporting,,Credit reporting company's investigation,Inadequate help over the phone,"XX/XX/XXXX I disputed a concern with all three credit bureaus. The dispute is with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MO XXXX. I received my credit reports from all XXXX agencies and was flabbergasted to see five late payments to XXXX XXXX. The original credit card company was XXXX who went out of business and sold my account to XXXX XXXX Bank on XX/XX/XXXX. The XXXX XXXX Bank also went out of business on XX/XX/XXXX. My account was now taken over by XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. In all this time I was making monthly payments and never late on them as I am never late with any payments with any company. When I received a letter from XXXX XXXX with a new credit card I was informed that my APR was going to be increased 12 % higher than it was originally from both the other companies. I called XXXX XXXX and voiced my concern about the overwhelming increase in the APR. The representative informed me there was nothing I could do about it I had to just pay the bill off with the new APR increase. I explained to the representative that I was a single mother on XXXX and I could not afford that extreme APR increase. I immediately cut up the card and threw it in the garbage. I made two payments to XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX I contacted XXXX XXXX a second time and asked for a supervisor. I was rerouted to another customer service representative from the company 's hardship program. I spoke to the representative at that time who informed me that I would qualify for their hardship program. She explained to me that their company would lower my APR and I could make lower monthly payments until the bill was paid off in full. There was no paperwork explaining how this program worked as stated by the representative it was just a verbal agreement. I agreed to this payment plan XX/XX/XXXX. I did not receive a letter from XXXX XXXX until 5 months later with my new payment plan which was now XX/XX/XXXX. I started paying off my balance every month faithfully as noted on my credit report. I have never had a late payment on my credit report since I first started getting credit with this company. When I received my yearly credit report from all XXXX agencies I was flabbergasted when I saw that XXXX put me into collections and reported to the agencies 5 months of late payments. I immediately called XXXX XXXX and spoke to another representative about this situation. This representative told me that I should have made monthly payments until the hardship program started. I explained to her I was never told to do that when I spoke to the representative from the hardship program. If I would have been informed of that I would have made payments each month as I always do. I asked to speak to a supervisor immediately. I spoke to a supervisor named XXXX XXXX XXXX. I explained my situation and XXXX XXXX apologized for the misinformation his employees did not make me aware of. It took 5 months to be put into their hardship program, and in the interim I was put into collections with 5 months of late payments. XXXX XXXX asked me to put this information in writing as I did. I received a letter a few months later from XXXX XXXX who informed me there was nothing he could do about my situation. I sent letters to all of the credit bureaus and both XXXX and XXXX immediately removed these negatives from my report. Trans Union is the only credit agency who refuses to remove the negatives. I am asking for help in having these negatives removed from Trans Union as I do not feel I should be penalized for the incompetence of XXXX practices, policies and employees misinformation.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NY,11581,,Consent provided,Web,11/13/15,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,No,1654914

Without warning, and without my consent, XXXX XXXX/Navient increased my monthly payments by 343 % ( sound familiar? ), causing my bank account to be overdrawn and forcing me to spend money I had set aside for taxes. I called XXXX XXXX/Navient and explained that I could not afford the payments they had set for me. After asking me several private questions, their "" automated system '' decided that I could, in fact, afford the amount they were automatically withdrawing from my bank account every month. The fact is that I 'm still paying my XXXX back taxes, and as a freelancer, I have to set aside 26 % of my paychecks, which XXXX XXXX/Navient does not take into account. After running the numbers, I have a monthly surplus of {$2.00}, and I do n't have health insurance. Their "" automated system '' informs them that I can pay {$470.00} a month. How is that possible? Why is my fate being decided by a computer anyhow? Should n't there be a sentient, cooperative human being helping me navigate through the worst financial crisis of the last sixty years? 

Both my mother and I have called XXXX XXXX/Navient to negotiate payments, only offering what we could afford. XXXX XXXX/Navient, however, denied our offers, stating that they were insufficient. It 's all we can afford, so how can it be insufficient? 

I am willing and prepared to expose what XXXX XXXX/Navient has done to my family and me. I hope that you understand my full resolve on this matter. I can no longer bare the indignities and financial agony that XXXX XXXX/Navient imposes on me. 

I have composed an XXXX-page letter detailing several instances in which XXXX XXXX/Navient was unfair, bullying, and undeniably incompetent. This letter also breaks down my monthly finances, proving that I can not afford the payments they demand. At your request, I can provide you with these full accounts.

107070,2015-09-30,Credit card,,Customer service / Customer relations,,"Let me tell you a story about CITI Bank and how they treat their cardholders. 

My family and I went on a XXXX, in XXXX of 2015. Before we left I contacted Citi Bank and informed with a nearly complete itinerary of where and when I would be in XXXX and that I would be making a substantial payment on my card so that I would have plenty of credit available. At the time I had a {$10000.00} limit. I was informed I was all set for my trip and that I would not have any problems. 
Apparently several days after I left ( remember CITI knows when I was leaving ), my credit limit was reduced by CITI to {$6500.00}, approximately how much was charged on the card, therefore I had about XXXX credit available. When I found out via a satellite courtesy call from the ship to CITI, an account manager recommended paying another {$1000.00} down on my card and I would be all set for the rest of my trip. So we did a phone transfer from my bank to the card. All set again right! 
So 5 or 6 days later when it came time to disembark in XXXX and come back to the good old USA, it turns out CITI refused the charge. Since it was the only card I had with me I was stuck, for all intents and purposes trapped with my wife and XXXX daughter. Fortunately another family member on board had another credit card for us to borrow. 
Finally about 3 or 4 weeks later we decided to confront CITI with this fiasco and how this happened. We called CITI and a customer care representative made about a half dozen excuses ' and then said CITI bank was sorry and they would give me {$100.00} for my trouble. I said that was unacceptable and I would like to speak to a manager/supervisor about this. There was no one available at the time, so we being understanding offered to make an appointment for a call back. The appointment was made for 4 days later, during normal business hours. The phone call never came. I guess we are n't important enough to call back. 
So a couple of weeks later, a few days after the next bill was due and I did n't pay it. I decided that would be the best way to get a call back. I missed the call that came 3 1/2 weeks later. 
Finally I spoke to an array of CITI another 2 weeks after that, and here are the excuses : My second payment was put on a 5 day hold because it was my second large payment in a monthThe employee who advised me of making the second payment had no knowledge that the hold would be made ( even though it is one of their policies according to another CITI member ). 
I finished my phone call with a customer service manager ( named XXXX ) who proceeded to tell me that it was only bad timing ( possibly a coincidence ) and not CITI 's error in way whatsoever and there was nothing he could do for me. I took that as TOO BAD. 
I do n't believe in coincidences, these decisions were made by CITI intentionally to get as much repayment as possible regardless of the cost to me the customer. I plan on taking CITI to some type of civil court so I can at least expose their ruthless inhumane to more people.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NY,11554,,Consent provided,Web,09/30/15,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,1586842

In the end, I chose to go to XXXX because it was going to be the cheaper option XXXX $ XXXX versus the XXXX XXXX colleges were looking for, even after financial aid kicked in ). I only "" qualified '' for approximately {$12000.00} in Federal Loans, so I had to look to private loans to finance the rest ( I am XXXX of XXXX children, so my parents could not pay for my college tuition ). Fast forward four years ( and XXXX degree later ), and I have {$12000.00} in Federal Loan debt and a whopping {$61000.00} in private loan debt through Navient ( formerly XXXX XXXX XXXX. My parents were able to pay {$500.00} a month while I was in still college to keep the interest off, but it did not affect the principal amount. After I graduated, I took the responsibility off of my parents and I began paying the loans myself. I got a job that paid {$33000.00} a year, which, after taxes, lands me {$1900.00} a month. Unfortunately for me, Navient wanted {$900.00} a month in payments. I called to have them lower the payments ( I was willing to accept a longer payment term and, therefore, more money paid in the end ), but they could only bring me down to {$450.00} a month ( and this is an interest-only payment plan, meaning I am not making a dent in the principal amount ). I pay {$850.00} a month in rent, about {$100.00} in utilities, {$50.00} in medical expenses, {$110.00} for public transportation, and let 's not forget the {$140.00} a month Federal Loan payment. This leaves me with {$190.00} dollars to live off of for the month ... in New York XXXX. 

When I tried calling Navient to have them lower this again, they told me I was "" not eligible '' for a lower payment plan. I asked them to put me through to the department anyway, and they put me through to their main customer service number, initiating a vicious cycle of holding for various departments. I have called twice a week for a few weeks now in an attempt to speak to someone in the department that assigns lower payments, and I have had no success. My last payment of {$450.00} was due on the third of this month and I was unable to pay it AND unable to speak to anyone at Navient about my inability to pay it. When I have called and said that I am financially unable to make my payment, they again put me through to the main customer service line. 

All of this frustration drove me to look at options for refinancing. Even if I ended up with the same payment in the end, I was hoping to find a company that was willing to work with me or, at least, answer the phone. I have tried to apply to several refinancing services ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, etc. ) and all have the initial requirement of attending at least a United States college ( if not a college from a specific list, as XXXX requires XXXX.

Complaint Againt Select Portfolio

Customer Assistance Group, 
XXXX TX XXXX


Dear Sir or Madam,
I wish to file an official complaint against Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. for deceptive business practices.
I was paying my mortgage timely until Hurricane XXXX occurred.  Hurricane XXXX forced me to vacate the property due to flooding and damage that resulted from said storm.  Select Portfolio is well aware of the situation pertaining to the property and the coinciding insurance company involved.  I have been fighting with the insurance company for the past 2 years regarding their obligation to cover the necessary repairs to the subject property.
Prior to Hurricane XXXX I occupied the XXXX floor and I had XXXX tenants on the XXXX floor.  After the storm, everyone, including myself had to vacate the property due to the severe damage that resulted from said storm.  I had to go rent an apartment for $1,500.00 and maintain the mortgage payment on the subject property simultaneously.  I was able to do for nineteen months without severe strain on my finances.  I have now reached a point where I can no longer continue to maintain the payments.  I have completed the repairs to the XXXX floors and the XXXX apartments upstairs are now rentable.  I currently have the XXXX apartment rented out and should have the XXXX apartment rented out shortly. My own monies were used to finalize the construction on the XXXX floor of the building and I continue to struggle to complete reconstruction in hopes that I am able to secure part or all of the insurance monies due.
The insurance company has denied my claim and I am currently in litigation with said entity over the damage that occurred to my property from hurricane XXXX.  We went through arbitration XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and still they refused to pay on the claim.  The only remaining option as per the mediator at this time is to file suit, which I did as they refused to negotiate in good faith. 
The lender, Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. has refused to work with me or assist me in any way in overcoming my short term financial issues.  
Further note that said entity has monies in escrow to cover repairs to the subject property.  Given that the insurance company has yet to pay my claim, I reasonably plan to request said funds be released to myself so that I may complete the necessary repairs to my property.
Please note that I made a substantial deposit at the time of purchase totaling 20% of the total purchase price.   I have consistently paid my mortgage and only recently ran into some short term financial issues due to circumstances outside of my control.
I don't believe it reasonable to commence foreclosure proceedings against me given that I have proven my ability and willingness to do what is necessary to keep my property.  I am working diligently to address the financial issues faced due to Hurricane XXXX.
I reasonably believe what's reasonable is for the bank to work with myself and release part or most of the escrow monies to myself so that I may complete the construction work to be done. 
Further, I believe they should stop any and all types of foreclosure action against myself as I have proven to be a conscientious borrower who ran into some short term financial issues due to circumstances outside of my control.
Please let me know how you are able to assist me with this most serious matter.
I have attached copies of the numerous filings that I have made against the insurance company trying to address this matter promptly as well as photos of the damage caused by Hurricane XXXX for your review.
I thank you in advance for your anticipated prompted response in this most urgent matter,

We purchased the apartment next door so that we could combine the XXXX units & build a bedroom for our baby. Previously, her bedroom was the living room. The Wells Fargo mortgage banker, XXXX XXXX informed us about holding funds in escrow until the wall separating the XXXX units was removed & stove removed with the gas line in XXXX of the XXXX kitchens capped. We were provided with no other requirements. We closed XX/XX/XXXX due to Wells Fargo administrative & mortgage banker issues. We waited until XX/XX/XXXX for the tenant in the new unit to move out. We started our gut renovation project shortly thereafter. We signed XXXX pages of closing documents two days before XX/XX/XXXX & included were clauses allowing Wells Fargo to indefinitely withhold these funds from us, despite what was repeated to us on how simple the requirements were. Who at a real estate closing will read every single page they are signing? In XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, a Wells Fargo employee, assigned to monitor the status of the renovation informed us an invoice is needed, plus the wall removal & gas line cap. Per XXXX 's notes, it was not disclosed that an invoice paid in full was required. In XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX informed us for the first time that the invoice from the contractor & paid in full evidence was now a requirement. We explained we needed to wait for the contractor to close permits, plus inspection to be conducted by the architect, & a building board member or superintendent before paying the balance in full. We explained we needed the funds in escrow to pay the final balance. We do not feel comfortable paying the full balance to the contractor before all inspections are complete for fear there are issues that need to be addressed & we no longer have any incentive for the contractor to fix any issues. We now need the funds in escrow to pay the full balance because we have no funds. The contract states the construction would be completed within XXXX weeks. As of XXXX XXXX, 2015 we are now in week 28.5 of the project. The contractor extorted us for more money & threatened to both put a lien on our property & report us to DOB if we did not pay. We 've been out of a kitchen for over XXXX months & counting, due to the renovation. We 've been forced to purchase all of our meals. Regardless of why we need the escrow funds released, we fulfilled all of the original requirements Wells Fargo provided. When we requested a list of requirements in XX/XX/XXXX, we were not provided any official documentation. We were introduced to a new requirement to be fulfilled. We spoke with XXXX XXXX & asked her to help us navigate this outstanding issue. She informed us what will be required is evidence that a significant portion of the costs covered, plus the invoice. This would indicate most of the work was completed & paid for. We provided a copy of the contract, displaying the full scope of work & cost. We forwarded copies of all bank checks cashed by the contractor. We currently owe 5 % of the contract cost. This is insufficient for Wells Fargo to release our funds from escrow. We feel Wells Fargo is creating more requirements at their will, making it difficult for us to access our funds & not being transparent. As you can imagine, when a construction project runs over by XXXX weeks, with missing materials that need to be re-purchased, & a contractor who is purposely slowing the pace of work down, the last thing we need is the bank to renege on its original word of the conditions by which our funds would be withheld from us.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NY,100XX,,Consent provided,Web,09/03/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1550597

This is in regard to a Home Equity Line of Credit ( "" HELOC '' ) and is supported by a sworn affidavit based on firsthand personal knowledge. XXXX has written several inquiries in the form of Qualified Written Requests ( "" QWRs ) to Chase ( JPMCB ) in an effort to ascertain information about the subject HELOC without success ( Attachment A ). Letters sent to Chase asking pertinent details were not answered in full as required by RESPA 12 USC 2605 -e. 


Evidence found in the public record and copies of certain documents received from Chase ( JPMCB ) in response to requests reveal that fraudulent activity has taken place throughout the transaction, from the beginning, and that fraudulent activity continues to the present day. 
In violation of RESPA, Chase failed to respond to QWR inquiries into the relevance and significance of XXXX different account numbers associated with the Home Equity Line of Credit ; Chase failed to respond to QWR inquiries into 'Accounting and servicing systems ' stating, "" This information is proprietary and will not be provided. "" ; Chase failed to fully respond to QWR inquiries into 'Debits and credits ' stating, "" Some of this information is either proprietary or unavailable, and will not be provided. "" ; Chase failed to fully respond to QWR 'Servicing-related questions ', stating, in part, "" Any assignment of the Security Instrument, previous sellers, purchasers, assignors, and assignees would be a matter of public record. Please review public record for this information. "" ; and, "" Some of the information requested under this section is either proprietary or unavailable, and will not be provided. "" ; Chase failed to respond simple "" yes '' or "" no '' questions in QWR dated XX/XX/XXXX. 
There is evidence that the original Loan Application contained figures falsified by Chase - not by the Applicants - representing amounts which greatly overstated Applicant ( s ) true monthly income under each of the XXXX the sections captioned "" Gross Income '' for the Applicant ( s ). 
We allege that the original application was altered by parties employed or authorized by Chase without Applicants ' knowledge or permission in order to monetize and/or securitize the line of credit. 
It is our position that the alterations were made with the intent of increasing the value of the application and/or related documents to Chase for use in subsequent JPMCB deals, transactions, sales, conversions, contracts, and other schemes to benefit JPMCB. 
In addition, unbeknownst to Applicant ( s ), JPMCB converted or otherwise misused Applicant ( s ) personal information and data on the application, along with the other documents/and credit agreements Applicants were induced to sign, to create other type ( s ) of financial instrument ( s ) and/or securities. 
Applicants did not sign a Note. It is our position that JPMCB ( Chase ), in fraudulently creating said Note ( s ), engaged in Identity Theft of XXXX 's personal identifying information in violation of the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of XX/XX/XXXX ( "" the Act '' ), 18 USC 1028, making it a felony to knowingly transfer without lawful authority a means of identification of another person with the intent to commit ... or aid and abet any unlawful activity.

The charge that was reported to XXXX was grossly inflated due to what I feel were inappropriate NSF charges. Even though I did n't think the report was fair, I did pay the amount owed to M & T, in full, less than one year after it was report to XXXX. Around XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, I attempted to open a First Time Home Club account with XXXX & XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, but both were declined due to M & T 's XX/XX/XXXX XXXX report. After being declined by other banks, my housing counselor advised me to speak with M & T to see if they could withdraw the XXXX report. I contacted M & T at a branch to inquire about them withdrawing the XXXX report, but was informed that they could n't do that. However, they told me, I could open the First Time Home Club account with them. It seems preposterous that a company can report someone for a delinquent account ( which I believe was not legitimately delinquent ) & then force that same person to use only that bank. It seems to me that the system is designed ( at least in this instance ) to ensure that a consumer has no choice but to select a certain bank. To make matters worse, after successfully completing the First Time Home Club program and receiving the mortgage, and without informing me, M & T switched our First Time Home Club account to a different type of account that charges a monthly fee of {$7.00}. I believe it is the practice of M & T to do this to others in the First Time Home Club program. The account was charged the {$7.00} fee each month until the balance went negative, then it was written off by M & T -- all without ever disclosing the fees or sending me a statement. Upon completing the First Time Home Club program, I told M & T of our new address ( as was required in order to take funds from that account ) but M & T never updated the address for the account. Interestingly, they did have the correct address for our mortgage account. When I inquired about this with M & T they told me it was my fault for not changing the address and that I can not obtain the funds I had remaining in my account before the fees were charged and the account was written off ( they refused to confirm whether this account was also report to XXXX, but implied it was not ). They also provided me with several old statements and told me a fee was only charged XXXX times, but upon reviewing the statements I discovered at least XXXX as many fees as they claimed.

I put done {$5000.00} on a {$7000.00} car, but for some reason Westlake just sent me a bill for over {$8000.00} not sure where they get that number from. On XXXX XXXX my car was repossessed because I was behind on payments due to me being furloughed from my job with the state of XXXX. I paid off the outstanding balance within 72 hours and wanted to get my car back. 
I was told by Westlake customer services that by paying the outstanding balance the car would be held in XXXX and would not go to auction. After I paid the balance I contacted Westlake customer services and they could n't locate the car, the car had been moved 4 times and was no longer located in XXXX State. It took Westlake customer services over a week to find the car, when they located the SUV it was in XXXX at an auction house. 
Westlake failed to send the release papers to the tow company which meant I could n't pick up the car and it took Westlake over a week or more of me calling everyday sometimes hourly for them to send the release papers. I contact Westlake customer services and got very little help and was transferred to other departments I asked to speak to a manager and was told "" no '' rudely. I tried contacting their corporate headquarters and got no reply. 
The vendor/sub-contractor Westlake used to tow my car lost the plats to the car and I needed a notarized letter from Westlake stating that in order for me to get new plats for the car, Westlake customer services had me contact the towing company for the letter which they responded with no and stated that it 's not their policy to give notarized letters I then contacted Westlake again and was told someone would call me back. In addition, I found out that the SUV windows were left open and the inside now has water damage that needs to be fixed. I keep trying to contact someone in management at Westlake and all I 'm ever told is that someone will call me back which they never do. 
It 's now one month later and I still do not have the car back Westlake is demanding payment for the car but it 's in their possession. Due to this stress caused by Westlake I have miss days off from work and the stress has aggravated my medical issues. I would like to end my contract with this company as they are very unprofessional, rude, and they are predatory lenders. 
Reviews of Westlake online are negative and other people have had the same problems with Westlake as I have. Could you please help me bring a much needed resolution to this problem because Westlake will not respond to my calls or emails, my account number is XXXX.

At XXXX 's suggestion to protect me from any unpaid charges, XXXX XXXX established her own delivery account, which XXXX approved. She was billed directly for her oil usage and for the service agreement that year. 

When XXXX XXXX vacated my property in early XXXX XXXX, I contacted XXXX and was advised that XXXX XXXX 's account would be charged for oilusage through XXXX XXXX, XXXX and for any additional oil needed to fill the tank. 

In XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, a XXXX representative, emailed me and required that I pay an unpaid invoice of XXXX XXXX 's, in the amount of {$510.00}. When I refused because I am not contractually obligated to pay XXXX XXXX 's unpaid account balance, XXXX XXXX XXXX became belligerent, confrontational, and threatened legal action. There was no desire to reach an agreement, and this raised my suspicions of XXXX 's tactics. For awhile, XXXX co-mingled my and XXXX XXXX 's accounts. I refused to make a payment after my {$320.00} payment of XXXX XXXX, XXXX until XXXX could assure me that my account had been satisfactorily cleared of her charges. 

With my account balance still uncertain, XXXX closed my account on XXXX XXXX, XXXX for nonpayment, charging a total of {$170.00} in late fees and a {$390.00} early termination fee. 

In XXXX XXXX Credit XXXX XXXX XXXX emailed me that she had removed the {$580.00} service agreement charge and transferred XXXX charges ( of {$580.00} and {$690.00} ) to XXXX XXXX 's account. 

My XXXX XXXX account balance remained {$2500.00}, unchanged since XXXX XXXX when the {$390.00} penalty had been imposed, and failed to reflect the {$580.00} credit I had been promised. XXXX showed no desire to keep its promises and to correct my account balance, so I held back my payment. 

Even if that credit had been applied, I believed that XXXX had other corrections to make. It should reopen my account and forgive the {$390.00} penalty and {$170.00} in late charges, prove that XXXX XXXX 's account had been charged to top off the tank in XXXX XXXX and that the {$510.00} delivery charge of XXXX XXXX, XXXX was mine. Coming just five and one-half weeks after the XXXX XXXX delivery, I doubted using that much oil, since the house had been mostly unoccupied with the thermostat set at a very low XXXX degrees.

The corrected {$2000.00} balance sent for collection reflected the {$580.00} credit I had been promised but never given the opportunity to pay.

Effective XXXX, the bank transferred the loan to XXXX Bank, but disclosure Letter from BOA said "" not to worry if we were in refinance process ; that it would n't effect the refinance ''. Then, On or about XXXX XXXX, when We were approx.a week from the refi closing, BOA sent notice of declining/withdrawing the loan application and cancelling the deal, saying title issues would take too long due to probate issues. There were no probate issues and the title company had cleared all title issues via affidavits etc and was prepared to close and notified the lender directly via their software upload prior to the XXXX XXXX termination letter. 
When we reached out to the BOA loan officer, he said he would straighten it all out and not to worry. He was on vaction but it would be corrected. He literally cursed his back office folks for the error and acted very upset that they had done this to us. 
Then there was little contact for many days and finally, an email apology from the loan officer that there was nothing he could do and nothing the BOA could do. Loan was with another lender and now because we had stopped making mortgage payment prior to the pending closing -- in view of the Loan Payoff letter that was to have frozen escrow and final payoff amount for the Extension/Consolidation/Modification documents, XXXX and BOA each pointing fingers and no one acknowledging or correcting their errors. 
We were told to try again next year when the loan did n't have a late payment for 12 months. 
First of all, we were still in the 60 day Period of a mortgage loan transfer that a lender ca n't penalize a borrower if payment is late. 
Second, we were in the final stages of the refinance and an erroneous title issue was being blamed for the bank to back out of a very attractive 30 year rate. The rates had risen. The Bank Of America would no doubt have incurred costs and expenses to re-establish our commitment with their investor channel or to secure the loan back from XXXX and then honor the commitment rate. So, they decided to decline the loan and disregard our rights and any concern of harm to us. Third, I am a hard working XXXX ; single mother of XXXX children, and a borrower of XXXX XXXX descent and wish assistance, as such, since I am unsure if these factors entered into to the Bank of America 's decision not to protect me and honor their commitment and rate lock.

That the Loan officer failed to live up to his consumer origination obligations, Remedy : We request assistance from the CFPB to require Bank of America to honor its mortgage commitment and rate lock agreement.

I transferred a balance to my SLATE card, and began making regular payments right away despite the fact that the marketing materials for the card stated that the balance would be interest free for 15 months. In fact, I set my XXXX bank account to make transfer payments directly from my bank account to SLATE so as to ensure speedy delivery. These payments were made regularly. 

One month, I set my Chase account to make a payment to SLATE the day before the due date set on the notice from SLATE. And, according to my banking records from XXXX, that payment left my account electronically the day before the due date on the credit card statement I received from SLATE. 

However, in my next bill from SLATE, I saw that my payment was deemed late and a {$25.00} fee assessed, despite the fact that the payment had been posted as leaving my account a day before the due date required by SLATE, and despite that SLATE 's marketing materials had clearly stated that my balance transfer would be "" interest free '', which implies that no fees would be assessed either. 

I called SLATE customer service and tried to resolve this matter because it was clear that I had indeed paid by the due date, and have the charge reversed, but was told that even though the payment was posted from XXXX a day before SLATE 's due date, the due date was on a weekend and therefore I was responsible for having the bill posted earlier than the day before, to allow for weekend interruption. 

XXXX I do not see how that is the consumer 's responsibility to post money PRIOR to a due date provided by SLATE, and XXXX it seems clear to me that SLATE likely did indeed have the money as my XXXX statement indicated that the amount had left my account on a business day, but is taking advantage to charge onerous and unnecessary fees to consumers. 

I explained to SLATE that I disagreed with this charge and disputed it, and would be closing my account. I paid my balance in full, except for the disputed {$25.00}. Instead of removing the {$25.00} charge, or at the very least keeping the matter at the {$25.00} fee in dispute, SLATE now charges me an extra {$15.00} every month related to my good faith dispute. My current balance- despite having paid my balance in full and closed my account several months ago and having made no additional charges- is {$55.00}. Therefore, I am being charged an interest rate of over 100 % for good faith dispute of a charge. 

I have called Slate 's customer service line to discuss this, but have not received a live human to speak to, and because my account is closed, the system does not seem to recognize my old account number.

I received the attached letter denying this request, stating my credit score resulted in the denial for the reasons below. My Credit Score is XXXX which is below average however I have an excellent payment history with Discover and all of my student loan servicers despite the astronomical amount and unbearably high interest rates. My interest rate with Discover is 10.875 %. 
1. ) Serious Delinquency2. ) Proportion of Balances to Credit limits is too high on bank revolving or other revolving accounts. 
3. ) The time since delinquency is too recent or unknown4. ) Proportion of loan balances to loan amount is too high. 
Please see my responses below to each numbered item. 

RESPONSE TO 1. ) There are no delinquencies on my credit report and to the best of my knowledge there have been no delinquencies in my financial history since XXXX. Please see my full credit report attached. 
RESPONSE TO 2. ) I have minimal Credit Card Debt of {$800.00} which is paid on time and I have no overdue balance over my limit. If this is referring to my Student Loan Balances, the balance to credit limit ratio is due to high interest rates SUCH AS Discover 's Rate of 10.875 % RESPONSE TO 3. ) The Time since delinquency is not recent. As previously mentioned there are no delinquencies on my attached credit report which has balances dating back to XXXX. 

RESPONSE TO 4. ) The proportion of my Loan Balances to Loan Amounts are too high because of high interest rates again, citing XXXX high interest rates of 10.875 %. 

CONCLUSION : This application has been denied because of my credit score which has been directly impacted by Discover and my other Student Loan Servicers. Given the predatory policies of these lenders it is almost impossible to achieve an average to good credit score. I respectfully request that Discover takes into consideration my excellent payment history, reverses their decision and releases my cosigner.

The mechanic snapped my key off in the ignition of my car ( despite my explicit instruction not to try to turn the key ). The mechanic then gave me XXXX options : Pay him his egregious rate to replace the ignition and keys, or have the car towed to another shop ( cost of towing + repair of damage caused by first mechanic would not be cost-effective ). Under economic duress, I resigned to the former. 

XXXX/XXXX/15 : I called BofA / Visa to ask if there was a way to "" pre-dispute '' charges and explained the circumstances. I was told that notes would be made on my account given the circumstances, and that as soon as the card was run, I could file a dispute to stop the charges from posting. 
XXXX/XXXX/15 : I called BofA / Visa to reconfirm that the charges would not post, and I provided the name of the merchant. 
XXXX/XXXX/15 : After the car was returned ( with apparent additional malicious damage caused by the merchant - damage A/C, electrical, and punctured exhaust pipe ), I called BofA / Visa and was told that despite the information I was given previously by BofA / Visa, because the mechanic provided goods ( ignition and keys ) and service ( installing an ignition to replace the one he broke ), I would have to pay in full ( {$580.00} ) absent a fault in the goods or service. Because one of the keys was improperly cut and non-functioning, BofA allowed a dispute to proceed for {$150.00} for the key. That day, BofA also got the merchant on the phone. To avoid the dispute, the merchant flatly lied by denying that he ever ordered a second key, which I summarily disproved. BofA/Visa withheld {$150.00} ( of an amount that should have been XXXX % withheld ). 

I have since sold the car, and because of the damage to the Air Conditioning, and electrical, I had to reduce the price by {$500.00} ( then another {$500.00} at the time of negotiating the sale, so {$1000.00} total ). I also had to pay {$80.00} to repair the exhaust pipe. 

The merchant subsequently challenged my dispute. BofA/Visa have now come back to me requesting a "" signed second opinion letter from another qualified merchant in the same profession, on their business letterhead, that specifically details how each disputed item listed on the merchant 's original invoice is considered defective or not as described. The letter should include an explanation of the steps that are necessary to correct the merchandise or services, along with an estimated cost to repair. Second opinion letters based on a photograph are not considered valid. The qualified merchant must physically inspect the merchandise or service in dispute. "" There are several problems with this : ( 1 ) I no longer have the car ; ( 2 ) BofA/Visa did not provide me with any notice of this "" policy, '' ( 3 ) to attempt to retrieve the car from the gentleman who bought it from me would alone cost more than the value of the amount in dispute, ( 4 ) even if I were able to retrieve the car, the cost of a mechanic 's time, including inspection and letter writing, as BofA/Visa requests, would certainly exceed the value of the amount in dispute. 

The simple fact is that I brought my car to a mechanic. The mechanic broke my car. The mechanic charged me an obscene amount to "" fix '' the problems he caused, breaking several other things along the way ( all of which resulted in severe financial detriment to me ). BofA/Visa agreed, in advance, that the charges could be disputed so as not to ever process. BofA/Visa reneged on this promise, is bolstering the fraudulent activity and underhanded dealings of an unsavory mechanic, and is now imposing an unreasonable burden on me to attempt to resolve the matter myself.

They never said that this school has a very bad reputation with the XXXX and employers wont even look at you when you say that you went to that school.

I told her that because we were about to leave for XXXX, I needed to ensure our trip in XXXX was paid for before I left the XXXX & to cancel the wire transfer on XXXX XXXX 2015 & I would pay by credit card - which I did. When I returned from overseas on XXXX XXXX, 2015 & turned my phone on, there were XXXX messages from HSBC asking me to call them. I did so on XXXX XXXX and was told by XXXX that HSBC 's security department put a hold on the wire transfer because I was supposedly sending money to XXXX.

I was then called by XXXX at HSBC some hours later to advise that I would be responsible for the difference in the exchange rate as the XXXX dollar had fallen against the XXXX in the ensuing XXXX weeks. I said I was not responsible for the delay and that I should not have to pay for HSBC 's tardy service.

I asked her to call me back on Tuesday XXXX XXXX 2015 with an estimate of the costs involved. She did not. I called HSBC Premier department at XXXX and asked why I had not been called by XXXX and given an estimate of the costs involved. I was informed that she was not available. 
XXXX of HSBC then called me at XXXX today ( XXXX XXXX 2015 ) and advised that due to the current exchange rate, cancellation of the wire transfer would cost me an estimated $ XXXX. This is 10 % of our trip costs.

Thu, XX/XX/XXXX - by XXXX XXXX you know about foreclosure fraud, the mass fabrication of mortgage documents in state courts by banks attempting to foreclose on homeowners, you may have one nagging question : Why did banks have to resort to this illegal scheme? Was it just cheaper to mock up the documents than to provide the real ones? Did banks figure they simply had enough power over regulators, politicians and the courts to get away with it? ( They were probably right about that one. ) A newly unsealed lawsuit, which banks settled in XX/XX/XXXX for {$XXXX} XXXX, actually offers a different reason, providing a key answer to one of the persistent riddles of the financial crisis and its aftermath. The lawsuit states that banks resorted to fake documents because they could not legally establish true ownership of the loans when trying to foreclose. 
This reality, which banks did not contest but instead settled out of court, means that tens of millions of mortgages in America still lack a legitimate chain of ownership, with implications far into the future. And if Congress, supported by the Obama administration, goes back to the same housing finance system, with the same corrupt private entities who broke the nation 's private property system back in business packaging mortgages, then shame on all of us. 
The XX/XX/XXXX lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in both North and South Carolina, by a white-collar fraud specialist named XXXX XXXX, on behalf of the federal government, XXXX states and XXXX cities. XXXX banks, mortgage servicers and document processing companies are named in the lawsuit, including mega-banks like XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX, who fell into foreclosure herself in XX/XX/XXXX, researched her own mortgage documents and found massive fraud ( for example, one document claimed that XXXX Bank, listed as the owner of her mortgage, acquired ownership in XX/XX/XXXX, four months after they first filed for foreclosure ). She eventually examined tens of thousands of documents, enough to piece together the entire scheme. 
A mortgage has XXXX parts : the promissory note ( the IOU from the borrower to the lender ) and the mortgage, which creates the lien on the home in case of default. During the housing bubble, banks bought loans from originators, and then ( in a process known as securitization ) enacted a series of transactions that would eventually pool thousands of mortgages into bonds, sold all over the world to public pension funds, state and municipal governments and other investors. A trustee would pool the loans and sell the securities to investors, and the investors would get an annual percentage yield on their money.XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, New York XXXX : XXXXXXXXXXXX : ( XXXX ) XXXX : ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX at ( XXXX ) XXXX Committee for the Seventh Judicial DistrictAttorney Grievance XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, NY XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX : ( XXXX ) XXXX : Complaint False Claim Act Violation Neglect and Fraud Upon the Court Lacking Real Party of Interest Rule 17a BY XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX Falsely claiming to be the owner/holder of the mortgage ; Predatory claims : TILA RESPAHAMPrelated claims & Breach of contract/breach of trial mod ( HAMP XXXX ) Debt collection claims ( state and federal ) Wrongful foreclosure Consumer protection statutes ( DTPA ) Dear : Grievance Committee for the Seventh Judicial District XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are involved in fraudulently invoking the jurisdiction of the court ; IS NOT THE HOLDER OF THE NOTE NOR ANY DEED ATTACH!

I was instructed to send the funds via XXXX XXXX for a Charity Event. I depended on my bank to inform me if there was any problem with the check, they did not. When I went to withdraw the funds the teller apologized and said the check had not cleared and she could not give me the money. I explained I was happy to return when the check had cleared as this was for a new, freelance client and I wanted to be sure that check had cleared. Again, depending on the guidance and expertise of my bank to assure me of this. Unsolicited by me, at this time XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) XXXX, Financial Services Representative came over and said, "" I know you and this is OK ''. I again replied that the check was from a new employer and I needed to make sure the funds were fully cleared, I pointed out there were not enough funds in my own account to hold the check against. His reply was that yes it was cleared and all was fine. I repeated to him that I needed to make absolutely certain that the funds were available from that deposited check. He again said, "" It is ok ''. Assuredly I followed through with the task and sent the money as instructed via XXXX XXXX. My alleged boss informed me the days following that he needed more funds sent for the event. When another check arrived it was from a different lender in a different state. I then felt this was out of the ordinary and asked my employer if I 'd be executing any other types of tasks? When he did not respond to me at all I called the bank that alleged to have sent me the new check and they confirmed the check was fraudulent just by it 's description. I was relieved I had discovered this early on and called TD Bank to alert them immediately that my account may have been compromised, still believing the first check was in fact real since TD said it had cleared. I thought perhaps I was a victim of a bait and switch type scam at this point. To my dismay this is when the misinformation, avoidance and condescending treatment began from TD Bank. I called and asked a manager to please return my call, no one called. I called the XXXX number and asked to be connected to a supervisor or their fraud department, left messages and no one called me back. I went to the bank and was shocked and blindsided to learn that they were holding me 100 % liable for the funds. I asked to speak with XXXX as he told me that check cleared. I was further shocked to learn that XXXX no longer worked there and they told me his last day was the day he approved my withdrawal, which I found incredibly suspicious. I then filed an investigation and filed reports with the XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX and the FTC. Once I finally received paperwork from the bank ( which their employee was not forthcoming that I would need this paperwork when I said I 'd be filing a police report ) I filed a police report and provided it to the bank.

My interest is personal, as I have been struggling for about XXXX years to settle a foreclosure action. When I learned of the settlements, my hope was that the fines and business practice requirements you imposed would encourage these companies to follow not only the spirit, but the letter of their settlement agreements. 
Unfortunately, my experience is that they have not changed their practices. Therefore, I would like to lodge a formal complaint as they continue to pursue foreclosure and duplicitous modification programs based upon:1. False Assignments that are void as an operation of law2. Refusal to verify their "" standing '' to bring foreclosure3. Refusal to assign XXXX point of contact, either an attorney or an investor representative and/or a sub-servicer representative, for settlement conferences with either the State Court Judge or NY Supreme Court Judge.

4. Ocwen employees refused to identify themselves with a business card for future follow-up during these meetings.

Failure to comply with a NY Supreme Court Justice 's demands for evidence of standing by either producing the blue ink note or the trust documents that lists my property as party of the above stated trust7. Failure to acknowledge that the publicly available Trust Documents filed with the SEC do not list my loan characteristics under the section "" Assumed Loan Characteristics '' 8.

125658,2015-12-11,Credit card,,Late fee,,"I am writing today to file a complaint against PayPal Credit. I believe their practices to be deceptive and fraudulent, having wrongfully charged me late fees and interest charges over a 10 month period. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I made a purchase of {$670.00} with my PayPal Credit ( PPC ) acct. My billing cycle date was set as the XXXX of each month, and a payment due date XX/XX/XXXX. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I made my first payment of {$66.00} towards the balance, and set up a a further 9 mos. automatic payments to post on the XXXX of each month, with the final XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 
For each month from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX I received XXXX emails from PPC ; the first making me aware of an upcoming payment, and the second to let me know it had been received. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I received an email titled 'Time Sensitive PPC acct information ' which informed me that I missed an acct payment. Logging into my acct I was shocked to see an acct. balance of {$340.00}. For each month I had been made payments I had also been charged a late fee and interest which accted for the balance. 
Surprised, I called PayPal ( PP ) and was told that because my payments were received between my due date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and my cycle date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) their system was not sure which month to apply the payment to, which was 'Probably ' the reason for the fees. The service rep. offered to refund XXXX months fee for my 'good faith payments ' but for anything more I 'd have to write a letter to their investigations dept. explaining my case. 
This was made more shocking by the fact that prior to XX/XX/XXXX. I had NEVER been able to log in to my acct. page, and save for a single statement email I received on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I was NEVER able to see my acct balance. ( I believe the only reason I received this lone email is b/c after submitting several help requests to PP I was prompted to change my acct password on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) In PP the only link to anything resembling a credit page was a 'Bill Me Later ' link, that when clicked would link to a page informing you that that Bill Me Later ( BML ) was now PPC XXXX along with a link to my PPC page, which looped back to my main PP acct page. This happened no matter how I tried to access the acct - whether it was through links in the monthly payment emails, going directly to paypalcredit.com, or billmelater.com - they all sent me through the same loop between PP and BML, and never to an acct. page where I could see acct. statements. Even the lone statement email I received on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX had a link included that was titled 'Bill Me Later ' bringing me to the same loop. To this day, when I try and access my acct page I still get this loop! The ONLY time I was able to access my acct. page was when I was informed of a missed payment in XX/XX/XXXX, and they were asking for more money. 
2 wks after sending the letter re : my case I received a msg telling me my case had been resolved and that I would see a refund, if any in my acct. A wk later I called and was told by an agent told that they found I was not owed a refund. Pressed as to why I was told that b/c my payments were made btwn my due date and cycle date they WOULD count towards my balance, but they would NOT count towards a due date - neither the month the payment was made in, or the previous month they claim I was 'late ' to paying. Confused, I asked if that effectively meant there were 5-6 days of every month that I could not make a payment and have it count towards my due date, to which he replied YES, and that I should know, because that is how all credit accts the world over work! Furthermore, he told me it was my responsibility to check my statement every month, and that I should have received statement emails every month. 
Pressed further he offered to run an 'email check ' to make sure all of the emails were in fact sent, and received. Lo-and-behold that report came back saying I had in fact received all of those emails, and for that reason they could not refund my fees.",,"Paypal Holdings, Inc",NY,11222,,Consent provided,Web,12/11/15,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,1692982

I deposited the rest of the money - XXXX I went to my landlord and gave him the check. 
I received a e-mail saying that for the time of the investigation I am given XXXX $ credit. 
I did not know where this amount came from as I lost XXXX $ and for me it was crucial to make sure that I have proper amount on my account because if landlord can not cash the check it is very detrimental for my credibility in his eyes. So at XXXX I called Chase customer service again - to explain the situation and to make sure that the problem would be solved as promised previously - before XXXX. 
As records indicate - I had conversation for 21 minutes, confirmed everything, replied to multiple questions but I received no help and I could not speak for longer as I was working.

My reply was - please tell me exact time instead of "" a while ago '', question, my answer and I will give my comment. Finally, she told that it happened at XXXX pm. 
I explained that by XXXX I made just XXXX deposit but later I had to make more as Chase bank did not help me and disregarded promised to fix the problem by XXXX. So I always provided correct information and there are no inconsistencies. 
XXXX wanted to ask more questions. The conversation was already around 20 minutes and I realized that it was like a circle - unprofessional employee asks unprofessional questions in spite of the fact that she obviously had all the information in front of her. Moreover, it sounded like I was giving to Chase false information or had to justify myself when, in fact, Chase was supposed to give me the reasons why my XXXX $ disappeared in the Chase ATM machine. 
I did not want to sink in a see of unprofessional questions and I asked XXXX to admit that her remarks were incorrect but she avoided it and tried to continue in her accusatory-interrogation style. I could not accept it and asked to connect me with a more professional employee, she replied that I had to deal that number once again. Obviously it meant that at XXXX Monday I had to go to all these "" press XXXX, press XXXX '' torture but I am not a robot to do it as unlike Chase I do not have an army of employees ( although I believe it is reasonable to have fewer but more competent people ).

129111,2015-09-26,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"My husband and I purchased a home in XX/XX/XXXX and got our first mortgage through Wells Fargo and a second with XXXX. Unfortunately, we currently are very much underwater and have to delay retirement and much needed downsizing due to this situation for the foreseeable future. Wells Fargo solicited us in XX/XX/XXXX to do what we thought was a refinance. We did get a lower rate and changed our repayment term, but unbeknownst to us, this now makes us unable to get any kind of gov't assistance ( HAMP ect. ) because they say our mortgage originated after XX/XX/XXXX. If we had known that refinancing back in XX/XX/XXXX would preclude us from any further ( and much better ) gov't help later on, we would never had done the refinance. As I mentioned, the XXXX mortgage representative solicited us on this, so I feel they did this on purpose. I 've asked countless times if something could be done to help us- both companies- XXXX and Chase- and because we do n't have a financial hardship and because of the XX/XX/XXXX thing, they wo n't help us. And the other big point here is when we got the original mortgage, XXXX did a bridge loan because we had n't sold the house we were living in yet. I feel that should n't ever have been allowed, but it was. As a result, we had trouble selling our original house because the real estate market was just beginning to plummet here but we did n't know it yet. So we had XXXX houses ( and mortgages ) for six months back in XX/XX/XXXX putting us into pretty bad financial hardship then. The last point is, the house we are in now is in an area of multifamily homes with illegal renters which has led to a decline in our property values even less than what it should be for our area. You could say it is a somewhat blighted area. This has made matters worse and is a factor in me wanting to get out of here. 

We just feel that even though we unfortunately signed on the dotted line with all of this, we really were victims of mortgage practices that now are not allowed plus the whole idea that we ca n't get any help because we refinanced in XX/XX/XXXX even though we bought the house in XX/XX/XXXX ( which puts us squarely in the place of people who need help and are underwater ) is just outright unfair to me. Also, just because we are hardworking, taxpaying people does n't mean we should n't get some assistance too. My husband is XXXX and would like to retire but he ca n't because we ca n't sell this house. We could just foreclose like everyone else out there, but we would n't do that. However, I am not sure how long we can do this. Even if Chase ( the second XXXX holder ) could turn our mortgage into a personal loan that would be a great option here, but they said no on several occasions. The house is currently worth the first mortgage ( XXXX ) so that could easily be paid off with a sale. The problem is a sale currently would not pay off the second mortgage completely, but Chase wo n't budge on working with us on this. 

Sorry for the lengthy summary, but this has just been such a terrible experience and I do n't know what else to do. I feel these big banks ( ironically XXXX and Chase the XXXX that seemed to survive this whole financial mess really well even though they helped cause it ) have so much money and gov't encouragement to help people, but they really are n't.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NY,125XX,,Consent provided,Web,09/26/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1581696

129393,2015-07-19,Credit card,,Transaction issue,,"On XXXX, XXXX XXXX, 2015, my XXXX XXXX XXXX card was rejected for the payment of a {$130.00} bill at a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I had made purchases at this store many times in the past. The cashier informed me that I would have to call the credit card 's customer service number to resolve the issue. The XXXX customer service representative informed me that the card was rejected because the merchant was deemed a fraud risk. He was unable to provide me with any policy rules or payment ceilings that would guide me in future purchases, but he assured me that he had cleared my card for the immediate transaction while I was on the phone. 

I then called my XXXX account manager to join me on another call with XXXX XXXX customer service. It took 15 minutes for XXXX XXXX to go through a very long list of questions to verify that I was a co-holder of the credit card. This person then advised that several recent small transactions had 'flagged ' our credit card as at risk for fraud or theft as this is a common sign of illicit activity. Please note that all of these 'flagged ' transactions had occurred at local vendors we have been to on a regular basis to make frequent small purchases. She said that our home phone number had been auto-called to warn us of this flagging, but no message had been left when no one answered. The XXXX system then closed our account down when my transaction apparently triggered their security system 's program for possible fraud. She agreed to add my cell phone number to the account and said that now the all clear had been given for the {$130.00} purchase at XXXX XXXX /XXXX . 

My card was again rejected on my second trip to the same store for the same purchase. My husband then called XXXX XXXX and was told that it sometimes takes XXXX rejections to clear a flagged transaction. This representative could not provide a reason why the in-store cashier could n't ask for a photo ID and address to prove that I was the cardholder. 

I was finally able to pay for my prescription medicine on the third trip in 4 hours that day. However, my husband and I clearly remain at risk to have our credit card denied at any time. The reasons remain murky, but apparently have everything to do with protecting XXXX XXXX from loss at merchant locations attractive to thieves and nothing to do with any fraudulent activity associated with our card. I would expect that most stores in XXXX have some fraudulent credit card activity. However, it should be illegal for a credit card company to decline a card that has no suspicious activity merely because other people commit credit card fraud at the store. People should be judged on their activity - not on the store 's activity. Consumers should be allowed to make credit card payments without the fear of in-store humiliation and undeserved hassle. 

My husband and I have an excellent credit history and have never been late with a full monthly card payment. We would welcome a security system that has a mandatory XXXX-number PIN code input required for all transactions. Should this current risk assessment program deny any of our future transactions, we will cancel our XXXX XXXX card immediately.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",NY,105XX,,Consent provided,Web,07/19/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1473537
129500,2015-08-18,Credit card,,Customer service / Customer relations,,"I have a secured credit card through Elan Financial Services ( EFS ), which has a balance of {$300.00} with a security savings account attached to it holding {$500.00}. In XXXX I contacted EFS to inquire about closing this account. The first problem I had was with the Customer Service Representative ( CSR ). She acted like she did n't want to be bothered and kept answering my questions with XXXX word answers. Since she would n't elaborate in her answering I had to ask many questions, for which she sounded like she was getting frustrated with me. At the end of the conversation, what I knew was that they would close the account, use the money in the savings to pay the balance on the card and refund me the difference. She said I would need to wait XXXX billing cycles to receive the refund. On XXXX XXXX, I signed into my online account, as I periodically check all my online accounts to make sure nothing fraudulently is taking place. I saw my account was showing past due for the XXXX payment and they had charged my account a {$30.00} late fee. I immediately called to inquire and explained that I had closed the account. My encounter with this CSR was not much better than the first. Her response was, "" of course you had to make a payment you had a balance ''. Of course I know that with a regular credit card, if you have a balance you have to keep making payments until it 's paid off, but in this case I was specifically told that the balance on this card was going to be paid from the savings account. The CSR agreed to refund the late fee. I immediately went on the website to make the payment but in my panic of now being late I set the payment to be made from an account with insufficient funds. It was n't until XXXX XXXX when I received a NSF notice from the bank that I tried to make the payment from that I realized the payment did n't go through and the bank was charging me {$60.00} in NSF fees, EFS was charging me a {$25.00} returned payment fee. On XXXX XXXX I called EFS again. This time the the CSR was so rude that I actually started yelling and asked to speak to a manager. She said ok and then cut me off. I called right back and asked to speak to a manager. Sadly enough the manager was just as rude as the CSR and after going back and forth I said "" so you are n't going to help me '', he said "" well what do you want '', I said "" I would like the returned payment fee waived ''. He said we already waived the late fee and you were the one who set up the payment to be from your bank. There had been some confusion on my part as to whether the payment I set up was coming out of the secured savings account or the savings with my bank. Both of which together with the card was opened through XXXX XXXX. In the end, I spoke to someone at XXXX and they did waive the {$60.00}, but EFS would not refund the {$25.00}. My complaint here is not in regard to the fees but with the way I was treated by EFS. I have never in my life dealt with people at a financial institution that spoke to me so unprofessionally and so disrespectfully. I feel that if the first CSR had been the least bit helpful none of this would have happened. I pride myself on making my payments on time and in this case when I found out the payment was late I acted immediately. I called, tried to make a payment and then tried to rectify the situation. I did everything possible to do the right thing and all I got in return were people treating me in way that actually made me feel violated and sick to my stomach. In the end I asked the supervisor who the bank 's regulatory authority was and in a very nasty and condescending manor said "" the same as every other bank, the federal government '', but he could n't name the agency.

I am a widow of five years with XXXX sons in college. XX/XX/XXXX I notified Wells Fargo that I was unemployed and unable to make the mortgage payment until I was able to find work. The representative with Wells Fargo was very kind and advised that I keep them updated. Through the next few months, I did in fact keep Wells Fargo updated. By late XXXX, I became employed and was ready to continue with making my mortgage payments knowing full well that I had a back balance to pay. I contacted Wells Fargo, explaining to them the latter. I sent them a mortgage payment, inclusive of late fees. Within the next few weeks, my payment was returned and XX/XX/XXXX I found myself in a foreclosure status with them!! No warning whatsoever. I contacted Wells Fargo and they proceeded to explain that now that I was in foreclosure, they could no longer accept my payments, which I was fully capable of doing. Any and all conversations with Wells Fargo have been vague and uneducated. Shortly thereafter, I began the process of working with an agent within Wells Fargo that was helping me go through a loan modification process. I will estimate that this was XX/XX/XXXX. From the very beginning of this process, I advised the agent that I am the administrator to the estate of my property and that the deed is not in my name. Ok, the agent was fine with this. XX/XX/XXXX, I was approved for the "" temporary '' acceptance with the loan modification providing I was able to make XXXX consecutive payments ( automatically taken from my bank account ). This was in fact completed as Wells Fargo required. XX/XX/XXXX, communication with Wells Fargo stopped. I tried on several occasions to contact the agent but his voice mail was always full. I then contacted the normal customer service line and they then forwarded me to a person in Alaska with Wells Fargo. When speaking to this agent, she asked me to fax her the deed for the property. I advised her that from the very beginning, it should have been noted that the deed was not in my name. This agent in Alaska had no indication of this information. By this time, I did not know what to do or where to turn. I hired my own lawyer XX/XX/XXXX and explained everything. This lawyer was going to help me get the deed of the property transferred in my name. Shortly after this, yet another agent from Wells Fargo sent documentation to me, exactly the same as before XX/XX/XXXX, advising that she was going to assist me in the loan modification process ... .of which, I took to my lawyer. The loan modification process started all over again. By this time, there are so many additional fees on top of the balance owed to Wells Fargo, along with my own lawyers fees..all the while, I could 've been making the mortgage payment honestly. It is entirely absurd the way that Wells Fargo Mortgage company handles their customers. As of now, my lawyer has a Quick Claim Deed that is ready to be faxed to this loan modification agent. Let me add that this agent had no idea what a Quick Claim Deed even was, and wanted to know why I, myself did not have the deed in my name. Through much research on my own, I have found that dealing with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage is nothing but a nightmare. Honest people, like myself, getting the runaround for them to make more money.

When I received the letter and check I called Citibank 's customer service line. After 20 minutes on the phone where I asked if there were any known scams I was told to take the check to a local branch for verification. It seemed to make sense. However if you go to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency website ( XXXX ) it states that you should never accept a check from someone you do n't know and that as the payee it is up to you to pursue the maker of the check.

I was told that the funds that were posted and cleared. I was told that the cash from the check was available now. Later that day I went to another Citibank branch in nearby and again confirmed the cash balance and withdrew the {$2500.00} and proceeded with my assignment. Three business days later I saw that my checking account balance was reduced by {$2900.00}. I called the Citibank and was transferred to their fraud dept. and now the learning began. I was told that all cashier 's checks even those from another Citibank account are on HOLD for one business day. Any cashier 's check from a non-Citibank account can take up to four business days for verification. I called Citibank customer service to reach the manager of the local branch.

I was referred to a Citibank location 15 minutes away to the supervising manager who had his day off. I spoke to the assistant manager who was on the teller line. I then was referred to the area manager who told me that they would give the teller that I dealt with additional training. I asked about the bank 's responsibility and why I was misled. I was told that it was up to me to know. I received the attached form letter from Citibank absolving them from any responsibility. If there is n't adequate supervision, there is n't adequate training and the bank can save time and money because they have the OCC rule discussed above to hide behind. It 's a fraudster 's paradise.

So that means it ca n't be over 60 days late but they reported XXXX late. First of all they report {$610.00} to my XXXX and report as paid as agreed. But on my Experian account they reported {$960.00} late {$120.00}. How can they report the same account with a different amount to different credit reporting agency.

I tried to called child support to ask them why no one contact me first by phone or mail to let me know they was even going to report anything thing on my credit report to give me a chance to resovled this issue. Child Support just said the system does it on it own we can not control it write a letter to albany they said. Bascially thier is no one for me to talk you to resolved this matter. This is so unfair. The goal should be give the person a chance to pay his child support. Child support goal is to stop you from getting funding by trying to mess up your credit report so you ca n't get funding to get out of debt because they report way too soon not giving you a option of getting funding. Then they want to take your license if you do n't pay on time another way of stopping your funding and then they could put you in jail. Making Child support is by far the scariest agency out there. Child support all ready can freeze your bank account take your tax return and put you in jail. Why would they be trying to stop someone from getting funding by report to a credit reporting agency that may be the only way they can get out thier debt by getting a loan or new credit card. Atleast give the person a chance to settle in 30 days before you report it. They gave me no warning, and when I called no clear answer why they are reported my account differently. The machine did it they told me. This is stopping me from getting funding and am self employed this can take me out of business. Why would child support want to do that when I have XXXX kids to feed. I paying what child support ask me to pay on time. All child support cases will have arrears, because they push the order back to the filling date. The final order could take 6-9 month before it is a final order. Meaning that arrears will behind 6-9 month of back support. Most people do n't have {$3000.00} to {$10000.00} laying around they might need to take out a loan or credit card and child support is stopping that by reporting too soon.

I need to reduce my monthly private student loan payment of over {$700.00} due to financial hardship, and have gotten nowhere with the Navient customer service line. Over the course of the past few months I have placed many calls, and the only guidance I have received is to request a forbearance, as I am ineligible for deferment. I will not accept that the only solution to paying off my loans is to continue tacking on insurance payments to the principle amount ( {$90000.00} when combined with my public loans ). It would simply be financially negligent if I were to do so, and if Navient were to allow ( promote! ) this. I am XXXX years old, have no credit, have a low income with no way to pay off this gigantic debt in my lifetime - sound reminiscent of the 2008 housing bubble? It sure does to me. 

I have requested a payment that allows me to meet my other necessary living expenses - via multiple customer representative phone lines and email contacts - time and time again. I am always provided with the same response : Call the main phone number. Request a forbearance. 

I can not get a clear answer on what other options are available from Navient, while I have heard of many people accomplishing a lowered monthly payment through unknown avenues. 

I have sent paystubs, budget information, and bank statements seeking an alternative repayment plan, and have been circled back to the "" solution '' of forbearance each and every time, ensuring that I will be adding to my debt in perpetuity, while barely meeting the minimum payments to avoid defaulting. 

I am not asking for loan forgiveness. What I am requesting is a common-sense approach to repayment : income-based payments, graduated payments, etc. Not forbearance. Not accruing interest endlessly. If my requests for a reduced payment plan is not granted, I will be at risk of default. 
I need Navient to reply with real, genuine information and help, rather than suggesting I try talks with a stiffly scripted customer service phone line or email address that will return me to square one. I 've dealt with this too many times thus far. 

Education is supposed to be the bedrock of the American Dream - something that is meant to establish a level playing field, where every young person can begin his/her professional life on equal footing. 
These private student loan companies have cast the field at a 90 degree angle, and those of us who were not privileged enough to find ourselves with college funds are grasping desperately onto the edge, running the risk of falling off the field completely.

My daughter had gotten into a financial bind. She is XXXX and has always tried to be independent. Feeling ashamed of her situation, made the decision to seek help from her bank, Wells Fargo, instead of coming to myself for assistance. 
She has attended school part-time for the last two years to be accepted to a XXXX program. We found out in XXXX that a spot had been secured for her at XXXX XXXX University. This is the same school she attended and received a XXXX in XXXX and XXXX XXXX. She is intelligent, hardworking, and motivated. Unfortunately, she is not well educated in the world of finances or banking. I found out about her finances when I was trying to organize a budget for us when she returns to school in XXXX. 
The help that Wells Fargo gave her left her in a position that she would not be able to get out of for the rest of her life. This started when they told her she had to keep a balance of {$1500.00} in her checking account. This would be impossible for her and seems it would be quite evident by her ongoing banking with them. Wells Fargo 's help consisted of a loan at 12.25 %, a personal line of credit at 11.25 %, and a credit card that carries a 17 % on purchases and a 23.99 % on cash advances. The accounts she was signed up for also carry an annual fee of {$25.00}. She makes her minimum payments. The interest being charged every month is more than her payment. I realize she signed these agreements, but did so reluctantly. The person helping her even stated to her that she "" looked uncomfortable doing this ''. She had no idea what any of the interest rates meant or of the charges that went along with cash advances. I tried going into the bank with her and was told there was nothing they could do since she signed the agreements already. However, they were willing to run her credit again to see if they could get her yet another loan. 
I went on their website and not even being a customer ( which she has been since it was owned by Wachovia ) ; I can get a credit card with a balance transfer at 0 % interest and accounts that have no annual fee. They advertise all kinds of help for students. I am wondering why she was not offered any of that help. I do n't even know of a bank that does n't offer free checking and savings accounts ( well, now I do ). 
I have now exhausted all my avenues and put my credit in an unsatisfactory light trying to get her out of this mess. She is unable to get any other financial help in terms of loans for school due to the fact her credit is now maxed out. I am appalled and beside myself that a bank would do this to someone.

Because my friend and I had been given only one key for our room the night before, I called the front desk to learn if I could remain a second day in the same room. The man at the desk put me on hold while he checked with the front desk manager, he told me. When he came back to the line, he said that my room "" was taken care of. '' I assumed that meant that the hotel was offering it to me gratis for the problems of the previous night with the room key, so I planned to stay the second day. ( The key is needed to operate the elevator and electricity in the room as well as the door. ) There were additional problems when the telephone in the room later that day when the telephone stopped working. The room charge was $ XXXX/night. 

In emails with the general manager of the hotel, I was given only {$100.00} credit for the key problem. ( He claimed that the telephone was working although several members of the hotel staff knew otherwise, and a friend who tried to call me were told the phone was told my phone was not working. ) I thought he should keep the promise and give me a night gratis. If I had not been offered the second night for free, I would not have remained at the hotel, as I called in the early afternoon and I could have checked out without incurring the additional charge. 

I called Chase and told the story to the telephone rep requesting one night free. The Chase rep, however, suggested that I should ask for both nights free and promised to advocate on my behalf. She said she would be getting back to me for more information. I told her I had several emails with the general manager, which she asked me to save. 

I was very disappointed to receive a letter from Chase a few days later denying my claim. No one contacted me as I was promised to ask for evidence or if I might accept a refund for the single night which I had tried to request. I would have to be satisfied with the {$100.00} I had been given. 

I called and spoke to a supervisor but was told that there was nothing I could do. The decision was final, because of some law they sited. The reason is because a telephone, which was not really relevant to the hotel 's promise of the free room ( it was the missing door key the night before ), apparently the telephone is seen as a luxury. Lacking a room phone, therefore, and is not seen as a reason for a refund. I argued and argued, but nothing can be done. I have stayed at hotels all around the world. The rooms always have a telephone. When mine did not work, I did not stay in the hotel that night. After I finished my very late dinner, I stayed with a friend who lived nearby, saving the hotel some money for the early check out. 

But my issue is with Chase. Perhaps if the rep had not suggested I asked for two nights free ( {$400.00} ), I would have been given the one night free, as I had been promised. I have discussed this issue now twice with a Chase supervisor to no avail.

Bank of America is only the servicer of my mortgage. We have never borrowed any money nor has credit ever been extended by Bank of America. Issues regarding ownership have been raised by me in court and still have not been resolved. It is incumbent upon the assignee or purchaser to prove ownership and evidence of consideration paid and delivery of the account. TITLE XXXX - DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES [ Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ], 803. Definitions [ 15 USC XX/XX/XXXXa ]. ( 4 ) The term "" creditor '' means any person who offers or extends credit creating a debt or to whom a debt is owed, but such term does not include any person to the extent that he receives an assignment or transfer of a debt in default solely for the purpose of facilitating collection of such debt for another. My wife and I have Bank of America listed as creditor for a mortgage. There was never credit extended by this entity. As far as the FDCPA is concerned, a creditor is the original entity which loaned money to a consumer. It is not a collection agency ( or mortgage servicer ). Doing so is a violation of the FCRA and up to {$1000.00} in damages for each violation of the Act. Bank of America, named as Current Creditor, is misleading on XXXX credit reports, every month, since approximately XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America is only the servicer of my mortgage. Accordingly, no contract privitiy exists. They are not a true party of interest entitled to enforce either the note or mortgage and have committed assignment fraud and forged note endorsements in order to create the appearance of a genuine and valid chain-of-title. The fraud and forgery was discussed in depth in my court filings and a formal complaint was filed with my local FBI field office XX/XX/XXXX. The agent assisting me in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX indicated that a crime was indeed committed and referred me to the CFPB and the FDIC for further investigation. Additionally, I 've been a victim of predatory servicing based on their unfair and deceptive practices. My note requires me specifically to pay principle and interest only. Bank of America, as a servicer, unilaterally changed the terms and conditions of my note by demanding that I pay into an escrow account, for the life of the loan, which is contrary to the agreement, which they are not party to. This was a malicious attempt to create a "" manufactured default '' by increasing my monthly obligation by almost {$1000.00} per month XXXX {$1300.00} to {$2200.00} XXXX. After submitting {$1300.00}, as per the terms of the contract, BoA stated they ca n't accept a partial payment. According to the FTC, "" a statement that the transfer will not affect any terms or conditions of your mortgage, except those directly related to the servicing of the loan. For example, if your contract says you were allowed to pay property taxes and insurance premiums on your own, the new servicer can not demand that you establish an escrow account ''. This is n't conjecture. The fact that they 've tried to foreclose on my house twice, using this as a vehicle to establish a default is reprehensible. The implied duty of good faith and fair dealing holds that a duty exists which prohibits XXXX party to a contract from acting in such a manner as to prevent the other party from performing his obligations under the contract. The loan servicer acted in such a way as to prevent me from performing the obligations under the mortgage note. The remedy is to make the contract void. I did not assent to any agreement and any change was forced and involuntary.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",NY,14120,,Consent provided,Web,10/14/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1605451

We began to make the mortgage payments as responsible citizens and homeowners. Then in XX/XX/XXXX we became the victims of a scammer who convinced us that we can receive a lower mortgage payment through a modification with their assistance and advised us that we needed to stop making payments in order to qualify. Trusting the source that is just what we did and unfortunately this turned out to be a huge mistake. Because of this action going back and forth we were in this situation for over four years until we finally received a modification. Although, the modification we received from Bank of America was not affordable we accepted the offer under desperation to get out of the current foreclosure status. 

In the meantime XXXX XXXX health was deteriorating more and more to the point that XXXX XXXX his wife had to stop working in order to take care of XXXX XXXX.

XXXX XXXX was recently placed in a home care facility under the care of his doctor due to his XXXX. The clinic is now withdrawing over {$500.00} a month for his stay and care at the facility, leaving the spouse with less income to put tours the household.

The property has no equity, and we request Bank of America for a loan forgiveness on the second loan and we were denied. They are not willing to work with us even though there is no equity on the property and the second loan will never foreclose as the first loan will never allow this to happen. The only thing the second loan can eventually do at this time will be to place a lien on the property that they will never collect as again there is no equity. Even when XXXX XXXX pass which is what unfortunately, the spouse was told recently and if she decides to sell it will have to be a short sale so the lien will never be collected. It will be more cost effective to Bank of America to continue to collect the first mortgage as they are so far and forgive the second, even forgiving the second mortgage there is no equity. Bank of America is not willing to assist the borrower, the only thing they are willing to do is to review the loan for another possible modification, which they wont even qualify due to the expenses for the care of XXXX XXXX it would make more sense to offer a full forgiveness of the second loan.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",NY,11356,Older American,Consent provided,Web,07/22/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1474119

The collection processes were abusive at all levels against all Fair Debt Collection Practices Act guidelines to remedy a debt.

I am attaching documentation that shows how confusing and dishonest Key Bank 's posting practices are. Unfortunately, this kind of theft affects people like me who do not have assets and have poor credit. Otherwise, I would have an overdraft protection account and I would never incur these fees. This is not only about my funds being low, because actually my funds are n't low right now and I incurred the last XXXX overdraft notices with a positive balance! Now that 's Key Bank Magical Accounting for you! I 'm posting this now but i am accumulating some other concerns that I am noticing now that I am having to pay attention so closely to my account and not rely on Key Bank to do the math. Some of my items disappear from the ledger at times. The other thing that is happening now is that my pending items are coming out of pending status quickly. I will be addressing these things in future complaints. This is takes an incredible amount of my time. I am doing this for other folks who for various reasons are not able to study their accounts. There is no reason why the bank can not add and subtract well enough to keep track of people 's balances. I do n't even know how much I actually have in the bank now. I do n't know how to find out either. I have a ledger that I keep for my own records and it does not coincide with Key Bank 's accounting. Key Bank changes the order of debits and credits in order to receive overdraft funds from people who do not have assets or good credit in order to protect themselves from this stealing in which this bank participates. I have attached the overdraft notice that I received this morning XX/XX/XXXX. And I have attached the ledger from XX/XX/XXXX copied at several times during the day to show first that there is no record in the ledger itself of the XXXX that is credited to the account with the deposit that I made that morning. It shows up in the balance part of the ledger at the top of the page but not in the description. In addition, this same deposit that was made at the ATM disappears later in the day. as does the XXXX debit. Where do they go? There is a note that says that Key Bank is working on the account and some items might not be available, but the question is why would that deposit disappear when it was visible throughout the day as well as the XXXX charge. I have gotten XXXX overdrafts this week for moving money from my basic checking to the Hassle Free account which is my son 's account. They are both my accounts. I should not be penalized for moving my money around between accounts.

And the thing about it is that it would not matter to key bank at all if they lost my business.

On XXXX XXXX I sent another dispute to the company and did not receive a response. On XXXX XXXX I sent yet another dispute to the company advising them that they were in violation of the FDCPA by failure to respond. I did receive a response to this letter ... ... .with a judgment notice attached. 

When I looked at the filed judgment, which is not yet reporting on my credit report, I saw that Midland states that they sent judgment paperwork to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, an address I have not lived in for three years. I have moved twice since living at that address and each time I updated my address with the DMV, my creditors and filed a mail forwarding with the post office. In addition, I have had the same phone number for ten years and did not receive one phone call from Midland regarding this debt. 

I now know who they are attempting to collect for, an account that was charged off in XX/XX/XXXX yet Midland is reporting the date of last activity as XX/XX/XXXX. 

Please understand I am not trying to get out of my obligations to pay my debts. In XX/XX/XXXX I had moved to XXXX when offered position with a company. Within one week of moving to XXXX I discovered that I was pregnant. I started my new job and, after about a month of sitting in an office doing absolutely nothing and consistently asking the owners what their marketing strategy was, how I could help to bring in clients, etc. I was told that the company was a debt settlement company interested only in settling the debts of their clients then forwarding those clients to me for counseling. However, the clients were not interested in the extra fee for this service and the department was closed, leaving me without a job. My husband 's income covered our rent, food and utilities. We had no extra money. I was able to obtain another job but as soon as I did, my husband lost his job. 

At six month of XXXX we were told our baby had a XXXX and an XXXX. We were sent for further testing, I was put on medication that did regulate the baby 's XXXX, however, the XXXX did not correct itself. We decided, at nine months XXXX, to come home to XXXX where our family and friends were. We had gone through our savings making these XXXX large moves in under a year, we had no money. We stayed with a friend. When the baby was born he was born healthy, but we relied on a friend to provide the baby with clothing and diapers. We were on XXXX and food stamps. We could not afford to pay the bills. 

We did start to get back on our feet and my husband was able to find work. This covered rent for our own apartment and a room for the baby. Unfortunately the baby was not reaching his milestones and at XXXX months old was diagnosed with XXXX. Since then we have been in XXXX, fighting for services and trying to help our son develop and reach his goals. At almost XXXX years old he is still XXXX. But we are getting there ... .slowly but surely. 

We had to move from XXXX XXXX to XXXX when my husband was offered a better job. We are currently renting a home, the baby has excellent teachers working with him and he has made terrific progress.

I have now hired legal counsel to assist with the fight and they have n't responded to him either. With no respect for the Attorney General, the FBI 's attempt to identify fraud they have ignored the appeal for justice on the part of consumers versus XXXX Bank which sold them the bad mortgage. Perhaps the law firm has not even utilized their legal department with regard to this matter because they are just billing the bank to extend their paycheck.

When I informed them of the fraud, they put me through the wringer with multiple lengthy phone calls and long meetings at the bank, then reimbursed me for the XXXX fraudulent transactions. The representative at the bank was new and not familiar with the protocol, and the managers decided that she should learn by feeling her way through this problem, which was not fair to her or to me. 

I combed through my bank accounts, looking for other instances of fraud, with no help from TD Bank. They could not provide even the most basic information about transactions, leaving me to do my own forensic accounting for hours. I discovered more instances of fraud, but the manager told me that I would not be reimbursed for anything over 90 days old. I asked for better fraud protection, such as a text alert for any transactions over a certain dollar amount. The representative told me they did not provide that and would not be doing it in the future. They repeatedly said "" It 's your responsibility to review your statements. "" TD Bank is making it harder for consumers to detect and prevent fraud, then they are refusing to reimburse for older transactions. Making this difficult for the consumer is beneficial for them financially. They are making money off of their unsecure banking. 

I would like to be reimbursed for the {$400.00} charge I found that is more than 90 days old, and I would like to be reimbursed for the XXXX overdraft fee that was caused by the fraud. Equally important, I 'd like TD Bank to change their policies : 1 ) Fraud is fraud, no matter when it happened, and 2 ) they need to make it easier for customers to monitor their accounts by allowing customers to set up text alerts.

Delayed approving or denying borrower applications : Under the new CFPB mortgage servicing rules, XXXX must evaluate a complete loss mitigation application within XXXX days, if it receives the complete application more than XXXX days before a foreclosure sale. XXXX also failed to adhere to these timelines. 
Failed to alert borrowers about incomplete applications : XXXX is responsible for reviewing borrowers ' initial loss mitigation applications to determine what documents are missing. It must then tell borrowers what documents are missing, usually by sending a "" missing document '' letter. XXXX failed to send, or delayed sending, missing document letters to borrowers. 
Miscalculated incomes : Eligibility for some loss mitigation programs, such as a loan modification, is highly dependent on borrower income. If borrowers have too much or too little income, they do not qualify. XXXX routinely miscalculated borrower income and wrongfully denied loan modifications. 
Denied applications for unspecified reasons : Under the CFPB 's new rules, mortgage servicers must provide the specific reason a complete loan modification application is rejected. XXXX policy was to say only "" not approved for loss mitigation options by the investor/owner of the loan, '' even though XXXX internal systems contained the true reason for the denial. 
Misinformed borrowers about their appeal rights : Under the CFPB 's new rules, XXXX must provide certain borrowers the right to appeal the denial of a loan modification.

By way of background, since I initially believed the collection agents owned the debt in question I filed a complaint with the CFPB against those agencies ( Case Number : XXXX ). However, through that process I discovered that despite being told otherwise for years, BofA had in fact never sold the debt. It is through this complaint that I am requesting to be repaid by BofA either the entire {$45000.00} collected until such time as BofA can verify exactly what is owed, or in the alternative I am asking for the {$15000.00} in interest and fees which I believe were illegally assessed to my account. 
After completing graduate school in XXXX and following the tech crisis and tragic events of XXXX XXXX I was unable to find continuous work for a period of years. Debt laden and without work, I fell behind on my credit card payments and eventually my account went into charge-off status in XXXX. Over the ensuing years the account was transferred to a number of collection agencies including XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX and XXXX. At all times I fully intended to repay the debt as soon as I was employed. In fact, I began repaying the collection agencies in XXXX and continued these monthly payments until I had satisfied the amounts allegedly due in XXXX. Throughout that time I repeatedly asked BofA 's agents to confirm the amounts owed and the legal owner of the debt. I was uniformly told that BofA had transferred the debt and that no fees or interest had been charged to the account post charge-off. However, no proof could be supplied. Believing I had no recourse I continued to make payments until the full amount requested had been satisfied. 
In XXXX, while cleaning out old papers I found a statement from XXXX XXXX which I had somehow previously overlooked. The statement clearly shows that interest and fees had been assessed to my account post charge-off. The statement attached to this complaint shows attorney 's fees of {$6000.00} and interest of {$9500.00} all of which was assessed to my account after it was charged off. 
However, despite being assessed these fees I never received a statement from BofA showing fees or interest being added to the principle due. In fact, post charge-off BofA stopped sending any statements to me. Importantly this fact is not in dispute. BofA admits it charged interest and fees to my account but amazingly can not tell me how much. Furthermore, in conversations with its representative XXXX XXXX, BofA acknowledges that it stopped sending statements once the account was charged off. As such, under the Truth in Lending Act BofA had no right to assess these amounts to my account and should be forced to return them. 
Since I can only demonstrate that {$15000.00} of interest and fees were assessed I am asking for that amount to be returned immediately. However, since BofA can not verify the debt in any fashion I would also ask that they return the entire {$45000.00} paid to them until such time as they can demonstrate exactly what is owed.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",NY,10028,,Consent provided,Web,03/25/15,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,1299920
141564,2015-09-03,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"I am writing to complain about ineffective and deceptive banking services provided by Citibank : Citibank enrolled me in Checking Plus, a deceptive and predatory product ; provided me inadequate assistance when I indicated concern about my account ; provided me notices in a language I do not understand ; and failed to investigate fraud I suspected occurred on my account. 
In or around XX/XX/XXXX I noticed on my statement that I was enrolled in a product called Checking Plus ( "" CP '' ) and that it appeared I had taken out a {$3200.00} loan. I did not recall consenting to the opening of the CP account, so I went to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, my local Citibank, to inquire about CP. The branch employee told me that CP was merely a loan offer. I understood CP to be a conventional loan, and I thought I would have to request money at a branch to utilize CP. The bank employee did not explain that Citibank would automatically transfer money to my checking account if I had a negative balance, or that I would be charged fees and interest without prior notice from Citibank. 
I told the representative that I only spoke XXXX, and I plainly brought in a statement in English. Citibank did not offer to provide XXXX notices at this time. During the next three years, I continued to reach out in XXXX about problems with my accounts and request statements in XXXX -- both via phone and at my local branch -- but I was never offered XXXX statements or notices. The bank 's failure to provide information in XXXX has made it impossible to fully understand my accounts or address my concerns with the bank. 
During the next two years, I continued to bank as I had in the past. But because I was misinformed about how CP worked, I accumulated at least {$260.00} in fees and {$3400.00} in debt-at least {$630.00} of this amount in interest. Because my paycheck is deposited on Fridays, on Saturdays I would check my balance and then withdraw funds from my checking account for the upcoming week at my local branch ATM. I would never withdraw more than the displayed balance. With legal help, I recently learned that an automatic {$50.00} transfer to my saving account processed on Monday morning would overdraw my checking account. Instead of notifying me of the negative balance, Citibank automatically borrowed {$100.00} from the CP account at a 18.25 % interest rate and charged a {$10.00} fee. 
Each month I reviewed my statement to ensure my account balances looked correct. Because the fees and loan payments often neared the amount lent from CP to my checking account, I did not realize that I was borrowing money. But between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with Citibank representatives multiple times about the CP account because I was concerned after reviewing my statements. I was assured multiple times that CP was merely money that was available for me to use, even though all along I was actively borrowing money. Nobody explained that Citibank had already transferred money to my checking account, charged me fees, or made automatic payments from my checking account. I also brought up suspected fraud on my accounts but Citibank did not look into the fraud at any point in time. 
I realized that I was in substantial debt because of CP XX/XX/XXXX after I went to withdraw money and my checking balance was much lower than expected because of automatic payments to the maxed out CP account. I again brought up this issue with Citibank representatives : even after speaking to representatives in Spanish, I received written replies in English, which I could not understand. I am now in collections on this account, and continue to receive notices in English. 
Citibank failed to explain this product to me or address my concerns, and has made it impossible for me to effectively bank by communicating with me in English. Because of Citibank 's CP product, I accumulated significant debt, fees, and interest without my consent.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NY,11378,,Consent provided,Web,09/03/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1550795

I fell behind in XX/XX/XXXX due to implications from XXXX XXXX.

I never received any paperwork to sign regarding this and was simply told over the phone that I would not have to make payments for 3 months and that after that my payments would be higher for a few months. I agreed to this verbally and when it came to resume payments Ocwen would not accept payments from me because my account now was delinquent and I defaulted by not making payments for three months. 
I have called Ocwen many times and at a certain point had it noted on my account that I only wish to speak with representatives from the US. I was assigned to a relationship manager, XXXX XXXX who told me that Ocwen has ways to help me keep my home and that she will email me the necessary information for a modification.

I once again submitted an application for a modification with Ocwen which I believe is still pending. The last time I spoke with XXXX XXXX was XX/XX/XXXX at which time she stated that Ocwen does not offer forebearance plans, and I must be confused. I obtained my payment history online and it has 3 months of payments listed as forebearance payments. At the same time, XXXX XXXX also stated that she needed income documents and other information that I had already submitted with my previous application.

142938,2015-04-25,Bank account or service,Other bank product/service,"Making/receiving payments, sending money",,"The loan system of TD Bank is very confusing. I was rejected today by TD bank to waive the late fee after my best effort to correct a late payment situation. I then realized that it is TD Bank 's deliberate intention to create this confusion to make extra profit by collecting late fees on customers. For a {$2400.00} tax escrow late payment, TD charges {$160.00}, which is 6.54 %. 

Almost all other banks I have dealt with either send a coupon booklet for XXXX month payments or mail a monthly statement consisting of both loan and escrow payment. In contrast, TD Bank mails out XXXX separate statements with XXXX payments due monthly. The XXXX is the escrow statement every month around XXXX and due on the XXXX of the following month while XXXX statement is for interest and principal payment around end of the month and due on the XXXX of the following month. Meanwhile TD requires the borrower to maintain a checking account for TD 's direct withdrawal. 

Ever since I had this loan at the XX/XX/XXXX, I have always made my payments on time. I usually set auto pay for the ones with coupon booklet. For those which do not send coupon booklet, I rely on their statement to pay my mortgage because the annually changed tax escrow amount. However, the past XXXX, for whatever reason I did not receive XXXX credit card statements and TD 's escrow statement on time. As soon as I was aware of the lateness, I contacted XXXX XXXX, my account manager from TD Bank. He advised me to pay personally at one of their branch. So I did and also established the auto transfer to my TD checking accounts according to my best estimate. From my track record, XXXX waived my late fee and interest immediately after I explained, but not the TD Bank. 
Before TD turned down my request, XXXX XXXX arranged a meeting with me and expressed that TD will need more business to exchange for this waiver. At the same time he also agreed with me that TD 's XXXX a month loan statements are inefficient and confusing. 
When I followed up with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that his supervisor rejected it because I have no potential profit to them. I am shocked that a world known bank would handle situation only based on interest instead of fairness and principle. I have been a manager in real estate business for XXXX years, never paid a late fee. All US banks small or large are very reasonable. They base your track record and allow you at least XXXX time late payment leeway. Nevertheless, the TD Bank refuses any refund for the bewildered system uniquely from all others regardless if you have been a good customer so that TD can easily earn the extra profit whenever an oversight happened. The late fee of {$160.00} was only for the lateness of the escrow. I wonder if I would be end up with another late fee of {$170.00} based on the same 6.54 % calculation if the XXXX part of payment which is for interest and principal of {$2700.00} was late. As a reference, I have a similar amount of loan with XXXX XXXX XXXX, its late fee for both loan and escrow is only {$87.00} per month. 

If a huge corporation like TD Bank has some ethic value in this business, I believe TD should at least give its customers one chance to refund their hard earned money and more importantly correct its system to clarify its parts of duty.",,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,NY,110XX,,Consent provided,Web,04/29/15,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,1347197

So I asked to speak to his supervisor because he was being so rude. So he put XXXX XXXX XXXX who claims to be a supervisor ) on the phone and XXXX said I have a {$1700.00} balance on a particular account that needs to be settled and that I can settle it today ( for {$800.00} ) and I said I do n't have that kind of money so he insisted on a payment which I paid {$100.00} on XXXX/XXXX/15 so he said I have until the end of the month to pay another {$700.00} to settle this account and I said I do n't know if I 'm going to have it so he said I will give you until XXXX XXXX to pay the {$700.00} if you do n't have it I will give you until the end of XXXX to pay a total of {$1000.00} to settle the account but by mid XXXX you have to make another {$350.00} payment so I did make that on XXXX/XXXX/15.

Commencing in XXXX, I entered into the process of loan modification negotiations with XXXX XXXX XXXX. Shortly after the process began, XXXX XXXX XXXX informed me that they had switched to Nationstar as their servicer and I was forced to submit all the paperwork over again. I then went for monthly modification negotiation meetings at Court and made the timely payments required. This process continued up until XXXX XXXX, when XXXX XXXX XXXX withdrew their foreclosure action. 
The next day, I received XXXX Certified letters from Nationstar saying that I was delinquent in my payments and that Nationstar was starting foreclosure actions against me. Impossible! 
My nightmare had only just begun. 
I noticed that I was not getting any other physical mail from Nationstar. Nationstar never sent me or my attorney any statements or other documentation confirming the payments I had been making. Also, my attorney was and is supposed to be copied on all correspondence from Nationstar and Nationstar has not done so. I had to go on-line to their website to get my statements and information. 
Upon viewing my account information on line, I found XXXX more letters ( which neither I nor my attorney ever received in the mail ) saying that my payments were only partial andNationstar was keeping my account in "" suspense '' pending full payment. What does this mean? Now, Nationstar claims that I owe them about {$8000.00} more due to fees and interest. 
Nationstar escrowed my taxes AFTER we agreed on a loan modification, making my monthly payment {$500.00} more per month! This was not a part of the terms of my loan modification! 
I am a homeowner who wants to pay my mortgage, but even as an honest hard working individual, it is impossible to keep up with the alleged "" fees '' that Nationstar keeps adding on without cause. None of these "" fees '' were reflected in my loan modification, nor was any of this discussed in the loan modification negotiations with the representative from XXXX XXXX XXXX at the pre-foreclosure meetings in Court. 
I can not refinance because Nationstar consistently keeps reporting me late even though my mortgage loan has been modified and I have been making timely payments. Nationstar has also threatened to put this on my credit report, thereby making it impossible for me to ever get out of this twisted situation and ensuring that I have no future. 
It took me 10 years to save up enough money to put a down payment on my home. For the past twelve ( 12 ) years, I have been paying for my home and maintaining my home and Nationstar wants to take my home away from me even though I have complied and cooperated completely!

Our first mortgage was modified and we are current with payments. Our family needs the 2nd loan modified so we can continue paying our loans and stay in our home.

XXXX XXXX stole my credit card in XXXX 2008 and used it for several weeks that month, forging my name to purchase hotel rooms, taxi rides, dinners, etc. totaling {$7300.00} for his use. This is a clear case of identity theft. He posed as a XXXX to help me with some work in my apartment solely to get my credit card to buy supplies and to have it authorized by me for that XXXX purchase on that day and convinced me to order XXXX in his name he never used because it arrived after the account had been closed as Citibank well knows. He stole the card, and with a fake ID he made stole my identity. He forged my signature for purchases all over town for three weeks buying anything but supplies for my apartment, of which I was completely unaware. Citibank knew it was fraud at the time because XXXX XXXX, of the Fraud XXXX Department, Citibank sent a letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2008 to inform me of the misuse of my card, following a phone call I had received from another Citibank XXXX a few days before informing me of the same. After receiving and reviewing my XXXX statement, I responded on XXXX XXXX, 2008 I reported the fraudulent purchases on my already closed account. XXXX XXXX acknowledged on XXXX XXXX, 2008 the receipt of my correspondence and the closure of my account for 'security reasons.

On the contrary, I informed the representative on that date that the purchases were fraudulent and that my card had been misused. Citibank stopped sending me statements on that card and then sued me for payment. What Citibank fails to understand is that XXXX XXXX stole my identity after he tricked me into authorizing him as a user to simply getting the construction job done. He had worked for several weeks prior to his theft to build up my trust in him to get the card he stole from me because he was completely out of touch during that three week period. I never knew where he lived anyway, but of course during that period he was living in the hotels my card was paying for. I will create an avadavit to gain access to the signed receipts and copies of the id he used, which I will prove is a fake. I certainly did not authorize XXXX XXXX to rob me. He tricked me into authorizing him and misused my card for as long as a time he could before my statement arrived and he would have been discovered by me, while Citibank watched all the time.

One day I log in to my account, I wanted to transfer funds from my checking account to the savings account, because even though at the time I opened the account I opened a checking and saving, they only allowed XXXX XXXX checks to the checking account, so after it posts I transfer it to the savings account to accrue interest. So back to three weeks ago I logged into to transfer money from my checking to saving, and it came up a error message that I need to call in. At first the representative asked me XXXX questions to make sure I 'm not using someone else 's identity, and even though they knew I was n't and I was fully verified, they figured that now that my account has approx. {$20000.00} it 's the perfect time to put a hold in order to make me miserable, and going through such aggravations that I was very close to a XXXX XXXX. The rep tells me "" We decided to close your account since the {$10000.00} check you deposited was not good '' First I asked for an explanation what not good means, and I was not given XXXX, all she said is "" I also does n't know but this is what I see in the notes, and there 's nothing more I can do for you!!

So I 'm basically now in a position where Capital One Bank has close to {$20000.00} of my money, and I 'm not being given a reason why, and they tell me they do n't have an answer for me what 's to be done next. The next day I call again, and I guess a representative with a little more feeling for another Human Being felt the pain I 'm going through, and she told me the reason is ( from what she can see in the notes ) is that Capital One has a feeling the XXXX check was either stolen or will be returned. I instantly called the company that issued me the check and explained everything I 'm going through, and unlike Capital One Bank that seek to make your life miserable, provided me with a copy of the check that it was cleared, along with a copy from his bank statements showing that the check was out. And I myself saw in back on the check that Capital One accepted the check and they have the funds. I instantly emailed it to Capital One, but as expected no response. So I called again for the next week every day several time, every time I was told I 'm being transferred to the fraud department, and after waiting 20 minutes I was told "" OH SORRY THEY TRANSFERRED YOU TO THE WRONG FRAUD DEPARTMENT '' and I was further transferred to a voice mail, I left XXXX of messages begging for a call back and offered everything in the world.

Bottom line, I opened an account, once I had close to {$20000.00} Capital One decided "" now is a good time to hold the funds, so we might pass the stress test '' and I was accused of not being XXXX XXXX, I was accused of depositing a stolen check, I was not given the opportunity to prove myself, and not even to prove myself in persona.

However, XXXX XXXX 's email response on XX/XX/XXXX was that I needed to initiate a dispute, which was effectively immediately done through their very restrictive website prohibiting ways to adequately formulate the nature of the complaint. Today, through EXPERIAN 'S report number XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX, it refutes my claim that the mortgage loan which XXXX had been servicing has indeed been paid. In fact my newest credit report dated XX/XX/XXXX, my order number : XXXX, shows the real estate accounts with Experian ; XXXX and XXXX remain at {$170000.00}. And to make matters even worse, the report also indicates that my credit scores with Experian and XXXX have been lowered to XXXX from a high of XXXX most recently, and probably XXXX will soon do the same. 
This is vexing and extremely humiliating since I have gone to extraodinary lenghts to pay off the mortgage loan to XXXX for an overall sum of {$170000.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, plus additional closing cost of {$16000.00} and an addtional remittance of {$2900.00} for taxes for which an escrow account already existed with XXXX.

EXPERIAN is acting in bad faith and does not show any concern for the right of the consumer who attempts, even through incredible financial losses, to maintain an honnest and credible financial status.

2.You have the right to be notified of the time and place of a public sale and/or of the time after which a private sale you goods will be made. 
3.If you have paid the seller sixty percent ( 60 % ) of the cash price for the goods he/she repossesses, or 60 % of your loan from a lender, the seller or lender must sell your repossessed goods within 90 days. If you have paid less than 60 % of the amounts due, the creditor does not have to sell the goods and he/she can keep both the goods and your money. When your creditor sells your repossessed goods, the money he/she receives goes first to his/her expenses from repossessing and selling the goods, then to satisfaction of the debt. If there is any money remaining, you will receive it. If your creditor did not receive enough money from the sale, he/she may sue you to make up the difference. 4.Until the creditor sells the goods, you have the right to pay all of your debt plus the creditor 's expenses in repossessing and preparing to sell the goods ( including reasonable legal expenses ).

I needed to wire XXXX to XXXX XXXX and observe the customer service there and also XXXX through XXXX XXXX and do the same as well. XXXX was for my pocket and XXXX went toward purchasing a printer at XXXX which was the first survey I needed to complete. 
Long story short, I became a victim of a scam as you may have caught on by now. I realized my mistake when researching on the internet and hearing the stories of others who have been victimized. Soon enough the check came as fraudulent. My husband called me the morning he tried to retrieve his check from work since he gets direct deposit and found that he could not withdraw the money. We live on a check by check basis. The last thing I ever wanted to do was to put my children in harm 's way by cashing a fake check.

When I immediately found out that the check was fraudulent I called the bank to let them know immediately everything that had happened. They connected me to the fraud department and I explained the situation to them.

I contacted Discover Student Loan, who services about {$85000.00} of my private student loan debt, because they advertise on their website that they have Repayment Assistance Programs for struggling borrowers. Several of the programs offer either reduced monthly payments or interest-only payments for a period of time. 

I spoke with a very pleasant lady who understood my issue and wanted to help. She took my information and looked into "" what programs I qualified for ''. She advised me, at this time, I do not qualify for any of the repayment assistance programs. I was n't sure exactly what she meant by this so I asked, what exactly would qualify me for the programs. She did not know, but simply that I did n't qualify. 

I asked what, in the future, I would need to do or have done to me in order to qualify for the student loan assistance programs. She said that she did n't know but that I simply am not eligible despite not being delinquent on any payments now or ever. 

I do n't understand what kind of game Discover is playing. If my situation is not the ideal one for the repayment assistance programs, I do n't know what is. I am being CRUSHED by student loan debt and, yet, I am doing everything in my power to not default or miss payments.

As a consequence, now that I am trying to re-finance my mortgage, I have to pay mortgage tax AGAIN ( ~ {$7200.00} ) - by not disclosing their policy, I was completely un-aware that I would be effectively penalized for switching lenders. As I understand, it is extremely rare for a lender to refuse to assign a mortgage to another lender. The lender should have disclosed this at loan inception so that I would understand how costly a refinancing could be. 
Furthermore, while it would have been questionable/bad practice to keep borrowers stuck like that, since Fifth Third can no longer do business in New York, I have no choice but to pay more than $ 7K to switch lenders and lower my rate ( currently 5.25 %, well above market ). Fifth Third should have notified all New York borrowers of this change and offered an equitable option. 
With all of the required disclosures, it shocks me that this was not among them. 
I spoke with a loan officer at Fifth Third about this issue and he was rude and very unprofessional, insisting they 're not obligated to disclose this information and giving sarcastic responses.

Unaware of the transactions I was deemed the "" billing '' party and not the "" shipping '' party. In the process of recovering the items from the individual who placed the charges on my account and being sure the items were returned, I discovered how difficult it is to return items because there is no recognizable footprint for internet transactions. If the "" shipped '' party does not possess their electronic record ( email confirmation of the transaction ), it may be difficult to access the electronic record any other way. Banks tell me they have no information for dot.com transactions. Merchants tell me they ca n't understand and synthesize their records and easily tie the records back to the original transactions. Meanwhile, the interest and fees charged by the credit card mount for the consumer. 
The problem with record keeping starts at purchase. In my case : Dot.com merchants never validated or asked whether the purchaser and the credit card owner were the same. With this, merchants invited the possibility of an unauthorized transaction and bear none of the burden of interest charges and fees or other consequences to the "" billed '' party. 

Once the transaction occurred, the merchant 's loyalty was only to the "" shipped '' party. Dot.com merchants did not recognize the "" billed '' party ( me ) as a legitimate party. Most would not correspond with me, send refund check for returned merchandise to me, share specific information about the account, or in some cases, even talk to me. 

As the 'billed '' party, I received only information on the credit card statement : transaction date, merchant, and total cost. These are not sufficient information to return an item for a refund. 
Ultimately, most of the items have been returned because of my persistance and luck with finding pieces of information. I am left with an estimated {$1000.00} in interest and fee charges. I feel the inaccessibility of information contributed greatly to not being able to return items sooner. 
At risk are those who are not tech savvy, the XXXX, the elderly, who could potentially incur large credit card balances and be unable to trace charges and make returns because of the morass of data surrounding their transactions should they be unable to keep accurate personal records.

Before I applied for a credit card, I was told XXXX things : ( 1 ) Home Depot will match appliances ' prices against all other it 's competitor like Best Buy, XXXX 's, and etc. so I will spend the lowest possible price for items in the market, ( 2 ) I will receive a promotional discount when I apply for a Home Depot credit card as a new customer/card holder ; 0 % interest and some additional percentage discount for XXXX transaction. Thus, I applied for Home Depot credit card as a new customer. I received 0 % APR on the account for 24 months with some percentage discount on the transaction ; but Home Depot refused to honor to match their price against Best Buy as they promised. I contacted Home Depot store 's manger a couple of times. Emails between me and the manager were exchanged as well as phone calls to Home Depot 's headquarter. However, Home Depot again failed to recognize their promised that they have made. I was lured into applying for Home Depot 's credit card under a false promise. 

After I applied for Home Depot 's credit card and I made I made a XXXX purchase on the account, I went online to Best Buy to see if Best Buy 's price was lesser than Home Depot, and it was lower. 

I bougth a total of XXXX appliances from Home Depot that qualified for price matching with Best Buy ; 1. Samsung Washer : XXXX, {$1000.00} XXXX Best Buy Price at that time : {$960.00} ) 2. Samsung Dryer : XXXX, {$1100.00} ( Best Buy Price at that time : {$1000.00} ) 3. Laundry Pedestal : XXXX, {$260.00} ( Best Buy Price at that time : {$240.00} ) 4. Laundry Pedestal : XXXX, {$260.00} ( Best Buy Price at that time : {$240.00} ) I discovered that Best Buy is selling cheaper than Home Depot ; thus, I was qualified for Home Depot to match it 's prices with Best Buy. I went to Home Depot store and asked for price matching, but the manager said he can not honor the deal that they have originally promised. I also sent emails to store 's manager and Home Depot 's customer service department in attempting to resolve the issue myself, but, again, my attempts were unsuccessful. 

I was told that I will get price matching before I signed up for Home Depot 's credit card as a condition. I would not have signed up for a credit card if there was no price matching advertising/promotion as they promised. And if Home Depot tell me at the time that no price matching was available, I would have gone to Best Buy instead. I was deceptive into applying for a credit card. 

I am not sure if there 's any miscommunication between me and Home Depot here but, at this point, I have exhausted all of available options in trying to resolve the issue myself.

XXXX What HappenedThe service is a medallion signature guarantee - in effect, a stamp from a bank or other financial institution that guarantees my signature, and has checked my ID to confirm that I am who I say I am. The bank is guaranteeing that I am not forging someone else 's signature, and will accept liability if somehow the signature turns out to be a forgery. 

Because a bank generally wo n't issue this guarantee to someone they do n't know, it 's best to obtain a signature guarantee from a bank or brokerage firm with which you do business. 

In my case, that 's HSBC. I have been a customer of HSBC for many years, and have a checking account there. ( I also have used HSBC for a business account for my small private business, which is no longer operating. ) I have lived in XXXX at the same address for almost XXXX years ( we own our house ) I am employed, and I pay my bills. 

Recently, my father has XXXX, and both he and my mother have signed power of attorney over to me. ( My father 's XXXX faculties are still acute, but XXXX ) They live in XXXX I live in XXXX. I have power of attorney over their bank accounts at XXXX Bank. 

My parents are not customers of HSBC bank. I am. 

And as a long-time HSBC customer, I expected the bank to guarantee my signature -- I came prepared with the signed, witnessed and notarized power of attorney docs, my XXXX state driver 's license and my XXXX passport, as well as the XXXX request for a signature guarantee. 

After some confusion -- the account executives at the branch on XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX did not what a medallion signature guarantee is -- the bank refused me this service after calling someone in operations in XXXX. XXXX in XXXX, who was also unfamiliar with the signature guarantee medallion, declined to provide this service because I was not transferring securities. 

It 's true that I am not transferring securities within HSBC, but I will be transferring securities as an agent for my parents ' financial affairs. 

There is probably no law that compels HSBC to issue the stamp. But this type of service is routinely provided to banks ' and brokerage firm customers as a courtesy. 

I can only conclude that HSBC is withholding this service because I am not a rich enough customer. 
Desired resolutionI want someone from the bank in the greater XXXX area or XXXX to issue a medallion signature guarantee ( guaranteeing my signature ) so that I can complete the process of becoming agents with power of attorney to my aging parents.

However, because of difficulties with the credentialing process and the state, I graduated with {$120000.00} in student loan debt ( that XXXX XXXX easily supplied to me ) but no teaching credential. So after some rough times I have finally found a steady job working full-time in XXXX at $ XXXX ( rather high for XXXX ). But now after several deferments and forbearance, Navient ( who XXXX XXXX sold my loan to ) has come asking for their money back, now totaling {$130000.00} and are asking for roughly $ XXXX, which is roughly half my paycheck. And I live in XXXX, which already requires a high rent and cost of living, and moving home is n't really an option for me because I am from the XXXX XXXX. 

I 've called Navient several times to try and find a way to extend the term of my loan, renegotiate payments, consolidate all my loans, and see just about any option they have of lowering my monthly payments. But because my loan originally comes from XXXX XXXX, they always say the only option I have is forbearance, which I am running out of. I would like to save some forbearance in case a time comes that I lose all of my income or something drastic happens. After pleading with them they have given me no options. My parents ca n't afford to help me pay that much every month. 

So the only optioned I thought of was to refinance with another bank that would be able to lower my payments. Well, because I have such a high debt to income ratio, no bank will approve a refinance loan. My credit is good. I have a couple missed payments but nothing too major. But I see no way of increasing my income or cutting my costs to the extent of being able to drastically alter my debt ratio to the "" acceptable '' point for the banks. And still, after all of this, Navient wo n't negotiate my loans. It has come to the point that I have thought about just not paying my loans back and suffering the consequences, which I would fully do if my mother were n't the cosigner on my loan meaning that defaulting would also wreck her credit. But now I feel like I have no other options left unless it 's taking on odd jobs such as selling XXXX or renting our couch out on XXXX.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",NY,11105,,Consent provided,Web,07/23/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1482718

The customer service representative was very nice on the phone and suggested a solution by putting me on a "" Promotion Allocation plan '' she said i can keep the same amount of monthly payment of {$73.00} which she said is definitely above the {$25.00} minimum payment and this should be sufficient enough to bring my total balance down as long as i keep these steady payments recurring monthly at {$73.00} per month.

These cases address the obligations of furnishers under federal and state law to supply accurate information, as well as a furnisher 's obligation to "" reinvestigate '' a consumer 's dispute. These cases also indicate that, for the time being at least, a heretofore unrecognized private right of action exists under Civil Code 1785.25 ( g ) and 1785.31 for failure to accurately report credit information in violation of 1785.25 ( a ). An understanding of the relevant history is important before one can properly evaluate the current state of the law and the XXXX decisions. 
The Original FCRA Legislation Applies To Credit Reporting Agencies OnlyThe Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), found at 15 U.S.C. 1681, et seq., was originally enacted in XXXX. The express purpose of the FCRA was to require that consumer reporting agencies adopt and implement "" reasonable procedures '' for ensuring that credit information about a consumer was collected, maintained, and dispensed "" in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy and proper utilization of such information ...

However, the credit bureaus do not follow through with any methodology a system that automatically removes an antiquated credit trade line, which leave creditors in control to remove a negative trade line at a later date by simply re-aging the trade line payment history. 
Notice that a positive trade line can be maintained for a XXXX year timeline from the credit procurement after the account has been closed out. The ten year timeline carries from the date the credit trade line was first reported to a credit reporting agency, or from the date of procurement of the debt. 
I demand the above referenced credit trade line removal based upon the passing of the seven/ten year timeline. And I maintain that there is no further relevancy to the debt being posted under FCRA guidelines. The above-referenced state cases show that the accuracy of credit reporting carries into state court cases as well, whereas a creditor can be brought up on serious civil charges outside of federally protected jurisdictions under FCRA.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NY,12010,Older American,Consent provided,Web,09/11/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1558627

I paid the {$2500.00} per month as long as I could using the {$60000.00} I originally refused. In order to get help I had to stop paying my mortgage. It took 2 years to get a modification on top of fighting, having stress, crying, borrowing from my parents and ruining my credit.

Seterus then sent us a letter stating our monthly payments were increased because shortage in escrow acct. we tried to explain that our mortgage was increased from {$1600.00}. To {$1600.00} for 52 months for this reason. They ignored this. 
We are aware Seterus is using any tactic to increase our mortgage payments. 
We had a debt with XXXX for {$4100.00}. which we paid in full XXXX XXXX. The account had a XXXX balance. Seterus said they paid this amount in XXXX XXXX. However, after contacting XXXX in XXXX XXXX, there was an outstanding balance a little over {$4000.00}. We made the full payment. 
Seterus sent XXXX {$4000.00} after account had XXXX balance. Seterus then informed us they increased the mortgage payments because they paid our bill in XXXX XXXX. 
I called and emailed DEP to forward the payment to Seterus but the only way XXXX can return the funds is if Seterus makes the request. We were advised to stop making payments and they will use the funds already in account. We will continue to make payments to XXXX. We have not authorized Seterus to make XXXX payments. We have asked Seterus to close our Escrow account as we wish to pay our Home Insurance as well as our taxes directly to avoid them increasing our mortgage payments. Seterus informed us they can not close escrow account because our contract states we need this account. Funny how they missed the script on no change to our loan payments. 
Today, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, we received a letter from Seterus informing us they will accept our payment but our loan remains in default and the creditor reserves the right to initiate foreclosure. 
We just began to attempt refinancing with our local bank as our current mortgage with Seterus is for 40 years. It has n't been one year with Seterus and they have proven to be unprofessional. We do not want to deal with Seterus. They are a nightmare! 

We have worked hard to restore our credit score to XXXX as we filed bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX. 
We are in Dire need of legal adviseWe have sent letters to Seterus and they continue to do what they do and all their letters have negative comments. 
We have filed a complaint with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in XXXX XXXX and we received a written letter from Seterus explaining the late charges. There are no late payments. 
Today we sent this info for legal advise to Just Answer and they suggested we file a complaint with The New York Attorney General and Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and CFPB.",,"Seterus, Inc.",NY,11385,,Consent provided,Web,07/08/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1458334

I became delinquent in my monthly mortgage payment because I have been unemployment the past 5 years. Last year I had to put my house located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NJ. XXXX on Short Sale. Thank God there was no buyer. I decided to ask W.F. if I could rent it and use it as my income in order to be able to do a modification. They accepted. Before putting my modification through they said your investor XXXX is offering you a mortgage payment of $ 3800/month or something in that range way more than the current rate that I got when I was employed. I said are you out of your mind? If I ca n't pay the current mortgage being {$1000.00} a month less than your offer how do you expect me to pay this? Why do you even offer such ridiculous plan. After that I filed the XXXX modification with the rental income of $ 2200/month. They denied it because based on what the agent at that time told me it did n't matter if I put the address where I get my mail or the address of the house in NJ. Therefore I used the mailing address. They denied because I should show that I live in the house that its address appears on the mortgage. Please ask them how could I live there if I have rented it out to somebody else? So again I demanded for another modification so that I use the NJ resident 's address instead. At this time they changed My agent to another agent named XXXX XXXX who called me once to introduced herself and after that I never heard from her again. I kept calling her and leaving her messages but no response. I finally had to ask to talk to her manager when I found out my modification case was closed by her w/out notifying or discussing it with me. I was furious. I said who is this XXXX XXXX why did she close my case. "" Sorry '' is the only word I heard from them. They gave me another agent named XXXX XXXX, Tel : XXXX Ext. XXXX who was a carbon copy of XXXX XXXX.

The whole problem is I fell behind because I had no job and not because I had an income and did not want to pay. I also stated that I would like the Escrow account charges to be included in the $ 2000/monthly mortgage that I had proposed. After two weeks I knew she is up to something that she had n't called.

The Original FCRA Legislation Applies To Credit Reporting Agencies OnlyThe Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), found at 15 U.S.C. 1681, et seq., was originally enacted in 1970. The express purpose of the FCRA was to require that consumer reporting agencies adopt and implement "" reasonable procedures '' for ensuring that credit information about a consumer was collected, maintained, and dispensed "" in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy and proper utilization of such information ...

'' FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ). However, the credit bureaus do not follow through with any methodology a system that automatically removes an antiquated credit trade line, which leave creditors in control to remove a negative trade line at a later date by simply re-aging the trade line payment history. 
Notice that a positive trade line can be maintained for a ten year timeline from the credit procurement after the account has been closed out. The ten year timeline carries from the date the credit trade line was first reported to a credit reporting agency, or from the date of procurement of the debt. 
I demand the above referenced credit trade line removal based upon the passing of the XXXX year timeline. And I maintain that there is no further relevancy to the debt being posted under FCRA guidelines. The above-referenced state cases show that the accuracy of credit reporting carries into state court cases as well, whereas a creditor can be brought up on serious civil charges outside of federally protected jurisdictions under FCRA.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,NY,12010,Older American,Consent provided,Web,09/11/15,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,No,1558629

162115,2015-07-07,Bank account or service,Other bank product/service,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"This is the XXXX complaint that I have filed against Capital One Bank during the last 57 days. For information regarding my initial complaint, which also involved my Rewards Money Market account ( hereafter, RMMA ), please see Case XXXX ( hereafter, Case XXXX ). 

A brief summary of the facts associated with Case XXXX will facilitate CFPB 's understanding of my current complaint:1 ) After making a {$230000.00} deposit to my RMMA in XX/XX/XXXX, I had, as of XX/XX/XXXX, not received reward points for the month of XXXX. Historically, Capital One Bank credited reward points to my RMMA within the XXXX five days of the new month. 

2 ) When I contacted Capital One, they cited a "" bank wide system issue '' as the reason for the delay in reward points posting to my account, a claim reiterated in a letter, dated XX/XX/XXXX, that I received after this issue was resolved. 

3 ) This letter also stated that the computer issue lasted from XXXX XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. Note that Case XXXX was actually filed two days after ( XXXX XXXX ) the computer issue that effected RMMAs was resolved. Yet reward points were not posted to my account until ~ XXXX XXXX and Capital One backdated this posting to XX/XX/XXXX. 

4 ) Finally, I know another individual who has a RMMA and he/she received his/her reward points during the XXXX five days of XXXX ( Note XXXX, below ). This fact appears to be inconsistent with a "" bank wide system issue '' - if the issue was "" system wide, '' presumably all RMMA accounts were effected, right? 

Onto my current submission:1 ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an unsigned, undated notice from Capital One Bank informing me that my RMMA was being closed. 

2 ) The notice did n't quite put it that way : instead, it stated that my ability to earn rewards points in my RMMA would end on XX/XX/XXXX and that the funds in the RMMA would be swept into a High Yield money market account in XX/XX/XXXX. 

3 ) I received this notice 53 days after Case XXXX was opened. Retaliation for contacting the CFPB? 

4 ) This notice arrived after a period ( XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ) in which I had redeemed a high number ( Note XXXX, below ) of rewards points ( XXXX ). Possibly, Capital One 's attitude towards RMMA holders is, "" Please, send us your money, because if you do then you 'll earn reward points (! ) but if you actually use a lot of these points in a short period of time, well, that will make us sad and we will close your account in order to foreclose the possibility of future sadness. "" In terms of outcomes, I would prefer to leave my funds in my RMMA and continue to earn rewards points. Hence, I have XXXX questions for Capital One : 1 ) Are all RMMAs like the one I hold being closed on XX/XX/XXXX? 2 ) If not, then why, exactly, is my RMMA being closed? 

Note 1 - I omitted this information from Case XXXX because I had not received permission from my friend to include it in that filing. Understand that my friend 's points posted the XXXX five days of XXXX - they appeared in his/her account during this period. In contrast, my points did not post until ~ XXXX XXXX and were backdated to XX/XX/XXXX by Capital One. 

Note 2 - By "" high, '' I mean relative to my perception of my annual spending on my Capital One Visa, which runs around {$16000.00}. A brief explanation is required : the rewards points referenced above are earned in a money market account offered by Capital One Bank.

I have a credit card account with Life XXXX Signature issued by U.S. Bank National Association located in the state of XXXX. I applied for this credit card when I received a pre-approved application by mail from them around one year and 3 months ago. The Life Miles credit card was mailed to me after I mailed the credit card application to the address they provided me. I traveled to XXXX in order to work there almost at the same time they mailed me the credit card but for some reason I never received the credit card by mail and of course I was not able to activate it because I never received it. 
I was offered a job in XXXX there and I traveled XXXX for work for one year and two months. When they mailed me the credit card application, they specified in the credit card application that the annual fee was free of charge. This was one of the reasons why I applied for the credit card. One of the reasons was that the annual fee was free of charge and also because I was getting some credit card benefits that were offered to me along with the credit card. I was planning to come back to NY to pick up my mail, pick up the credit card and activate it when I would be already back to The United States. 
I left for overseas before the credit card arrived and I stayed in XXXX for more than one year but on XXXX XXXX my mother passed away from XXXX in the state of XXXX. I traveled to XXXX, XXXX for the funeral and burial of my mother and to be with my family during this terrible time. 
I have been feeling very sad and destroyed by this that I did n't stop in XXXX but instead I traveled to XXXX, in XXXX. This is one of the XXXX. My wife is originally from XXXX and we were there for several weeks with my wife 's family because of the sadness and how hard it was for me and my family losing my mother. 
I returned to XXXX in the XX/XX/XXXX. When I returned to XXXX, I realized that U.S Bank was charging me some credit card bills for around 4 months without even notifying me or contacting me all about this matter. I called the credit card company and when I called the credit card company they informed me over the phone that they had sent my account to their accounts collections department and they also reported unfairly that I was paying late to the XXXX major credit bureaus XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. 
When I called the credit card company in XX/XX/XXXX to find out what was wrong, they explained to me that the Life Miles Signature credit card has an annual fee of {$65.00} but as I previously mentioned to you this was not mentioned in the pre-approved credit card invitation they sent me. I found out they were charging me around {$250.00} Dollars including the {$65.00} Dollars annual fee plus interest and late fees. This is very unfair to me. 
They were charging me an annual fee without even notifying me and I never received any phone call or voice message from U.S. Bank customer service representatives to inform me that I had an overdue bill. They never sent me e-mail messages even they have my e-mail address to notify me about this. My phone number in XXXX was also in service while I was in XXXX and they never called me to notify about this overdue bill.

I purchased with the purpose of an investment property. Unfortunately, it is located in a Zone A area, with a high potential of flooding. In XXXX, during Hurricane XXXX, the property sustained substantial damage, in which the space was no longer safe to rent, and the tenants had to move out. When I brought the insurance adjuster over to inspect the house, I found out that the property was vandalized and burglarized, with all of the heating and water pipes removed, windows broken, etc. while vacant. At that time, the insurance company refused to pay any claims. While I was able to obtain different insurance coverage, I was forced to finance the repairs out of pocket. 
While slowly repairing the damages from Hurricane XXXX and the burglary, XXXX XXXX XXXX devastated the area, and the home sustained even more damages than during Hurricane XXXX. All repairs ceased and I had to start from the beginning. Like many homeowners at that time, I then had to fight with my insurance company to cover incurred damages.

Although working with the insurance companies took a great deal of time, I was successful and was able to begin repairs. 
Throughout this time I have been in constant communication with the bank and had all intentions of rectifying the mortgage arrears once the repairs were completed. The series of events slowed down the process and made it almost impossible for me to be able to catch up. Unfortunately, since XXXX XXXX XXXX, the location of the property is considered severely depressed and unable to sell for anything close to the original purchasing price.

I am also including XXXX on the complaint because they are the owners/investors on my loan. While reviewing the CFPB 's website, I noted that CFPB had already filed a lawsuit against Green Tree Servicing for violations of several laws that we had been victims of. I spoke with a representative at CFPB and she suggested that I file a separate complaint explaining the details of what I had experienced. This complaint was initiated because we received a loan modification in XXXX XXXX from Green Tree Servicing that reduced our payment from XXXX to XXXX for 5 years. However, 2 years into the modification on XXXX XXXX, the payment went back to the regular amount of XXXX. This is our second mortgage. We have a 1st mortgage and the payment is already XXXX. That brings my total mortgage payment to XXXX ; this is TOO MUCH for my budget. I called Green Tree Servicing about the change and no one could explain the exact reason for the change except saying that the loan had went back to the original amount. I was also told that I had received enough help and I need to pay the original amount. While reading the lawsuit filed by CFPB I realized that been victims of all of the violations noted in the lawsuit. There are several things that Green Tree Servicing has done, as noted above they changed the loan modification that we were told we were being given. Below I will list all the other violations by Green Tree Servicing and XXXX ( as owners of our loan ) :1- From the moment Green Tree Servicing started servicing our loan which I believe was in XXXX ; they harassed us to no end. For 7 years they would call me and harass me. They would call my home and cell phone back to back for up to XXXX times a day. They would threaten me would foreclosure and everything imaginable. Their representatives were very condescending and would make rude remarks while on the phone. They people would make you feel like the XXXX of the earth. I tried to explain to them that I had a 1st mortgage that I was also trying to pay and catch up on but that did n't matter. Their representatives were very aggressive. 
2- Back in XXXX, my husband lost his job ; so we fell behind again. Green Tree Servicing started calling my relatives. In particular, they called my mother in law in Ohio and asked her what we were going to do about keeping our home. This was the ultimate embarrassment. 
3- Whenever we were behind and even after I had made arrangements with Green Tree , they would have someone come to our home and take pictures and leave threatening notes on or door. My neighbors noted this and even bought it to my attention. Once I went and spoke with the gentleman taking pictures and he replied you know what it is ; Green Tree sent me. This was after I had made arrangements with Green Tree. 
4- Another time, the representative from Green Tree called my bank to verify that the funds were in my account before she would take a payment over the phone. She called XXXX XXXX XXXX as a XXXX way call and spoke with a bank representative to ensure the funds were in my account. 
5- Also in the 7 years I had been dealing with Green Tree, I was always required to pay with a preauthorized payment in which I had to pay the XXXX fee. While I admit that I had some returned payment is n't there a grace that allows you to begin mailing payments again? I always paid the {$12.00} speedpay fee. It is n't until recently was I allowed to mail in payments.

And I saw there were XXXX unauthorized-transactions occurred on the statement with the total of {$3200.00}. I quickly grabbed my phone and call Citibank fraud department. The person asked me some questions regarding my card status. Did I ever lose my card? Was the card with me the all time or not? And couple more questions regarding the information so Citibank can conduct an investigation. 

After 3 days of waiting ( XXXX XXXX, 2015 ) without any update from Citibank, I decided to go into XXXX of the Citibank branches in the town. The manager told me that Citibank decided to refuse my claim and the reason will be provided once I received the letter from Citibank. The manager also tell me to close my account and everything and withdrawal all my money out because Citibank no longer want to have me as a customer. 

( XXXX XXXX, 2015 ) After 9 days of waiting I was shocked when I saw the letter, it stated that I was the one who authorized the fraud transaction that clearly occurred without me knowing it happen. I was so sad about the decision that Citibank come to accusing me of doing this fraud. 
Therefore I went back again the next day ( XXXX XXXX, 2015 ) to the branch and the manager ( XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ) refused to help me further more. 

I did n't give up just yet, and then I called once again to the Citibank customer service at the same day ( XXXX XXXX, 2015 ). The representative who answered my phone basically tell me to fax a letter stating that I was n't satisfied with the investigation result and they will considered appeal my claim for the second time. 

To shorten the story, I made the letter and then I tried to fax it using the fax machine from Citibank branch. First I went to the same XXXX on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, Their fax machine somehow could not do the faxing at that moment. 
Then I went to the on inside the XXXX building. First I went in there and banker named XXXX XXXX tell me to sit down in his desk and he tried to call Citibank fraud department once again. The answer was I have to file a police report in order to help me getting my claim reopened. 

Without giving me enough information, as a civilian who did n't know much about rules of filing police report I went to the police station near in the borough that the fraud happened. Then the policeman said that I have to obtain the statement where the fraud occurs from Citibank. The policeman even helped me to call Citibank customer service and they promised to email me the detail statement, which I never received until now ( XXXX XXXX, 2015 ). 

Then the next day ( XXXX XXXX, 2015 ) I went into the branch again ( XXXX building ) to meet XXXX XXXX the person who helped me before.

And XXXX was nice saying that do n't worry he would help me to fight for this claim and he will contact me if he heard any news from the fraud department.

Contrarily, Citimortgage has informed us that is not the case. We purchased our home in XXXX XXXX. In XXXX we began investigating ways to refinance the loan, however we were denied because of a reduction in home prices and income due to a job loss. By XXXX we began inquiring with Citimortgage about a loan modification, which we believed was possible through the Home Affordable Refinance Program. The process was painful and repetitive, involving multiple requests for similar documents worsened by changes in Citi staff, who often showed a lack of knowledge and concern for us. Miraculously, by the summer of XXXX we were able to successfully modify our loan, which saved us a modest {$400.00} a month. Throughout the process we understood that we were modifying our current loan. However, recently, when I inquired about the PMI, Citimortgage informed me that we actually had completed a conventional refinance, changing the LTV to the new loan price at the time of the XXXX closing. I disputed this understanding and was told that I should reference the promissory note, which I did. On the top of the document is prominently written, Consolidated Note and states that this note consolidates, extends, and modifies existing loan. We are confused. Furthermore, I suffered a job loss which caused loss of income and our home value had dropped significantly, precluding us from obtaining a conventional loan. We brought this to the attention of a friendly Branch Manager who reviewed our mortgage on an electronic database on her computer. She expressed some concern about the information then said that she could not speak to me about the matter. I asked her if she could refer me to an agent with whom I could speak. Instead she provided me with a mailing address to communicate with Citi. After several years of dealing with Citi in exhausting and overly complicated ways, we were reluctant to write.

I have been attempting to get a loan modification since I was current back in XXXX of XXXX. Back in XXXX of XXXX, XXXX hit our area and our basement was flooded and trees fell causing a lot of damage. My job was closed for almost two weeks as well so between not being paid and having to repair the damages, I depleted my savings quickly. In XXXX of XXXX, the tenant in the 2nd unit of the subject property stopped paying rent and we ended up having to evict the tenant which took months in court as they were stating they could not live in the property with the damages from the storm which was not true but this was held up in court for months not paying. The judge ordered the tenants to pay the arrears by a certain date which they did not and then after going to court again, they were given 60 days to move out. So this was well over a year with no rent received. After fixing the basement, we decided to rent this out to supplement the loss of rent on the 2nd unit but those tenants caused a lot of issues with the neighbors who ended up complaining to the town that we are not allowed to rent the basement. We ended up getting fined by the town for this so that rent income was only received for two months. During this same time, my mother, XXXX XXXX, became ill and moved in with me and once the tenants moved out, she moved into the 2nd unit. She does not have any income so she can not contribute to the household expenses. 
So by XXXX of XXXX, I no longer had money to pay my mortgage and fell behind. By the time I started working part time doing sales commissions, Indymac was no longer accepting payments. I understand my payment is already low after being modified in XXXX of XXXX getting a 2 % step rate modification. My payment increased on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX from {$2100.00} to {$2400.00} which is an increase of {$240.00} a month. I am hoping I can be reviewed for the HAMP modification in hopes my hardship and income will qualify and prove I can afford to resume making payments so I can keep this home I have put so much into and have been trying so hard to keep. I purchased this home in XXXX for {$550000.00} and have put well over {$150000.00} into the home between the damages left by tenants as well as repairs and upgrades needed.

There are many homes in my neighborhood that are boarded up for quite some time so selling even though that is the last thing I would want to do, would not be easy to say the least. 
Indymac is repeatedly denying my loan application stating I do not live in the subject property even though all my documents which includes all utility bills for gas, electric, water, cable and phone as well as my drivers license and vehicle registration all show this subject address. But because on credit it shows another residence which my family lives in and I have not resided at in over 10 years is showing, they will not accept that this is my primary residence. The best part is I have two jobs located XXXX which is very close to the subject property. The other residence the bank is stating I reside at is located in XXXX which is almost XXXX hours away. How would I possibly travel that far? Indymac is stating I would need to contact the credit bureaus to have this changed. I came to find out I would need to contact each bureau in writing and will be responded to in 90 days which by then, I would most likely have a scheduled foreclosure sale date. I was prompted by Indymac to correct my application to show this is not my primary residence so I could be reviewed for HAMP tier XXXX but then denied stating I was already reviewed for hamp 2 and my hardship didnt change.

XXXX of the charges were made at XXXX for {$110.00} each charge. The other charge was made from XXXX shop in Florida for {$110.00}. I am a XXXX year old woman residing in XXXX, NY with neither a XXXX account nor a do I own a car. When my son noticed these charges on XXXX XXXX, 2015 he immediately contacted Netspend by telephone while all XXXX charges were pending. He was told to wait for the charges to go through and then call them back. 

From there things only got worse and much more confusing. On XXXX XXXX, 2015 Netspend said they opened a dispute claim, # XXXX. They also told me via e-mail that "" we will attempt to complete the investigation within 10 business days. If we need more time we may take up to 45 calendar days to complete the investigation. If we determine more time is needed, we may issue a temporary credit so you have use of your funds during the investigation. '' Of course they never gave me the credit because they claimed I did not send them my signature, which was never requested by them. They also claimed I did not contact them in a certain amount of time. They were contacted within one day of the transactions. 

It is impossible to speak to a person in the "" fraud '' department because my son was told by the phone representatives that the fraud department does not speak to customers on the phone. He was also unable to get a last name or direct phone number from any of the representatives he spoke to on the telephone. In the meantime they decided on XXXX XXXX, 2015 to deny my claim. The reason they gave for this decision was that they did not receive my signature. I wrote back to them expressing my dissatisfaction with the outcome of their so-called "" investigation '' into this matter. I explained that I am a XXXX year old widow on a very low fixed income and need this money back. In fact, my XXXX payment was turned down because of insufficient funds and I was changed a {$12.00} late fee when this happened. This does not include all the {$1.00} fees that Netspend has been charging me for each fraudulent transaction. 

Consequently, they agreed to reopen my claim. This time I sent them a certified letter with the disputed charges and with my signature. Now I am being told it will take another 45 calendar days for their decision. As I explained earlier, this is causing me a big financial problem because of my very low fixed income. It is also causing me much stress as I worry about how I am going to make up for this {$330.00} that has been stolen from my account. 

. Their phone number is XXXX. This is a prepaid XXXX debit card account which I needed so my social security and pension checks could be deposited into since I do not have a checking account. Their address is Netspend Dispute Resolution Department ; XXXX. XXXX XXXX ; XXXX, TX. XXXX.

169266,2015-09-29,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Don't agree with fees charged,"I had a student loan that went into collection with Immediate Credit Recovery twenty or more years ago. The original loan amount was {$10000.00} and the interest rate 10 %. I set up automatic payments of {$250.00} a month that were deducted twice a month for at least ten of these years. I believe it was XX/XX/XXXX when they disclosed to me they could no longer make automatic deductions, so they began calling me to authorize payment. The original servicer was extremely rude and nasty and I had to speak to a supervisor in order to get someone humane. I also reduced my payments to once monthly, or {$120.00}. In XX/XX/XXXX I asked to settle the account for {$5000.00}. I was told that amount would never be authorized and I needed to make a payment of at least {$6200.00} to reflect 50 % of the remaining balance ( {$12000.00} on a {$10000.00} loan ). 

I called the school directly ( XXXX University ) and after several back and forth conversations between ICR, XXXX and myself the school authorized {$5000.00}. By this time however I had discovered that my payments to ICR had reached nearly {$30000.00} -- three times the amount borrowed. ICR could not explain to me why on-going payments were needed or even a lump sum to pay off the loan. In addition the school agreed that a 10 % interest rate on a student loan was now considered exorbitant ; however the school only communicated with me through ICR, which told me the offer to settle would expire within three business days. 

I called the CFPB three times for advice on whether or not to settle the account but was told there was no representative who could listen to my situation and guide me, and that I could only file a complaint. I did not want the collection agency to make my life any harder so I made the payment. 

After the payment was made, the servicer called to ask me to put in writing that i authorized each and every payment made on the account, which is in fact untrue. This is evidenced by the fact that i immediately cut my monthly payments in half when i was contacted by a live representative in XX/XX/XXXX.

169528,2015-12-29,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,,"Over the past month I have written many complaints against Key Bank. I am writing this last complaint to simply sum up the issues that I have with this bank. I hope that the bank will be audited for excessive overdrafting again in the future. I had XXXX accounts with Key Bank, a personal checking account and a Hassle Free account. The Hassle Free account was attached to my personal checking account as an account that my teenaged son could use. He is a XXXX since he was just turning XXXX. The Hassle Free account issued a debit card with his name and I was able to transfer funds from my account to his account easily. Often, I would get very close to a XXXX balance as I live pay check to paycheck. Often I would deposit money through an ATM machine which would theoretically give me access to XXXX dollars immediately. However, through Key Bank 's magical accounting system, when the ledger would be managed by the bank, items would bounce because actually there was not immediate access to the money through the on line account. 

I have several copies of my account and my son 's account as the bank was performing its processing during the evening and night hours. Often, the ledger shows a huge negative balance while the processing is happening. It 's hard to understand how a large modern bank like this has such antiquated accounting processes. I have an account in another bank and all transactions are immediate and neat. There is no messy, convoluted, unclear and dishonest practice that results in excessive overdrafts. 

Anyway, the result of my complaining was that Key Bank closed my checking account. I did not ask for this. This created complete havoc in my financial life. I had to stop direct deposits and go to another bank to open an account for me and my son. When I talked to XXXX the representative of Key Bank who closed my account she did not even understand that the Hassle Free Account was my son 's and was connected to my personal account. She was going to leave the Hassle Free account open. So not only does key bank participate in magical accounting that results in excessive overdrafts for folks, but key bank also does not pay attention to its costumers and participates in retribution. 

Lastly, for the years that I was involved with this bank, items would sit in the pending section of the account. Sometimes items would sit there for 10 days. But since Key Bank decided to close my account, items cleared within one day, even those items that were charged against the account by my son who is in another city. This shows that Key Bank purposefully leaves items in pending after which they reorder the debits to put the account in negative status. 

I know that my complaining as I have could make me seem crazy and also that folks could argue that I do not manage my money well. But I represent many people who have no assets and who live pay check to pay check. This bank is notorious for these practices that I have highlighted over the last two months. I hope that at some point, Key Bank will be held accountable for their dishonesty and poor customer service. In the last year, I have paid the good part of XXXX $ in over draft fees. I do not have that money to give to Key Bank. XXXX the customer service rep said that she valued my patronage. Well, if that were true, then I would have had the overdraft fees refunded to me as I requested and Key Bank would not have tried to punish me by closing my account.",,KEYCORP,NY,13820,,Consent provided,Web,12/29/15,Closed,Yes,Yes,1720931

Additionally, I asked for a full tax disbursement dating from XXXX ( or from the inception of the loan ). The property in question had Tax Reductions since XXXX ; so I asked that the following be specifically included:1 ) Disbursement XXXX Town Tax,2 XXXX Disbursement of XXXX School Tax XXXX and3 ) Disbursement of XXXX Tax. 
However, all that I have received to date are Closing Documents dated XXXX XXXX and a package of statements from XXXX and XXXX a huge gap XXXX to XXXX. These do not even slightly correspond to my request, nor do they substantiate the amount allegedly owed. Therefore, I reiterate my need and legal right to see the audit trail and applicable fees that supposedly add up to that exorbitant amount. THIS DEBT IS NOT VALID WITHOUT SUCH VERIFICATION. 

XXXX my disputation of the validity of the debt and my request for corroborative information were timely made ( within the allowed thirty XXXX 30 XXXX day period from receipt of notice ). However, I have not been afforded due diligence and good faith in reply, as I am still waiting for evidence of the debt 's legitimacy. Moreover, I have been notified by lawyer letters on my property in XXXX Court, New York. This action was commenced by your filing Notice of Pendency in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, for a Foreclosure Notice, which has be given without first proving that it has legal warrant - i.e., I have not received the requested information. Therefore, adherence to regulatory procedures as well as to the standard established by the FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT ( "" FDCPA '' ) in this matter has been inadequate and short.

170749,2015-08-10,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"I contacted Wells Fargo ( WF ) XX/XX/XXXX to inform them I would be unable to make my XX/XX/XXXX mortgage payment. The property was my primary residence for XXXX years but then became a rental due to market conditions when I had to relocate out of state. I did n't realize at the time that making it a rental would disqualify me from assistance programs - I was simply trying to make the payments. The property was listed for short sale and my short sale request was submitted to WF XX/XX/XXXX including an appropriate cash offer from a potential buyer. Months of documentation requests followed. XX/XX/XXXX I finally was told the short sale request was denied by HUD ( FHA loan ) due to monthly cash flow surplus. I disagreed with WF 's calculation and I was concerned they were including rental income when I no longer had tenants. After having difficulty getting in touch with anyone at WF ( I tried numerous numbers ) I went to HUD and they were able to escalate my case to a WF "" supervisor ''. The supervisor researched whether or not rental income was included in the calculation. This took at couple of weeks. The supervisor contacted me and told me that rental income had been excluded. I informed him that I still thought the calculation was incorrect and asked him to walk me through the numbers used. When I heard the number being used for my monthly income I immediately disagreed. The supervisor put me on hold and looked into the number. He came back and told me that the income number was miscalculated and should be about {$500.00} less per month. I requested that he refile a variance with HUD since the previously filed variance was incorrect and overestimated my monthly cash flow substantially. He denied my request stating that HUD denied the variance because of surplus. I argued that had the variance contained the correct surplus, which again was substantially less, my chances of having the variance approved would be greater ( as a variance is a request for an exception ). He refused. Conversation ended and I contacted HUD to request their review ( still pending ). A week or so later I receive a letter from the WF supervisor that he is looking into my inquiry and needs a week. After that week passed he called and said he needed two additional weeks. This now puts me to XX/XX/XXXX. The supervisor called on the last day of the XXXX weeks and essentially repeated our previous conversation. He had only researched AGAIN that rental income had been excluded. I do n't understand why it took nearly a month to look at the same question. I informed the supervisor that we agreed on the rental income part but that per our previous discussion the income amount was miscalculated. The call had been recorded. I repeated my request for a new variance. He said no unless there is a change in circumstance. I said the change is that the calculation was wrong. He still refused. I feel like they are not even truly researching my case and I 'm frustrated that this supervisor is supposedly the highest level of review. They submitted what he admitted to being an incorrect variance and then refused to resubmit a correct request. In addition to all of this, and during the middle of the supervisor 's review, I was served foreclosure papers. It was my understanding that banks could not proceed with foreclosure if my case was still being actively worked as that would be considered dual-tracking. 
I have been extremely responsive throughout the process and I 've done everything in my ability to bring this to a close as a short sale. I am still awaiting HUD 's review results but I believe I ca n't get anymore help from WF. Their calculation of my monthly cash flow is incorrect ( the supervisor agreed income was miscalculated ), my request for a CORRECT variance to be filed has been denied and this process has taken months too long.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NY,14217,,Consent provided,Web,08/10/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1510943

I immediately called Navient in XXXX and spoke with another agent. The agent set me up on the interest-only payment plan again and told me to disregard the XXXX bill because our agreement would take effect immediately. During the XXXX conversation, I provided the agent with my credit card number, so Navient could directly deduct the payments. Navient has been deducting the interest-only payments from my credit card since XXXX XXXX.

On XXXX XXXX, I called Navient for the third time to clear up this issue. I briefly spoke to an agent, and they told me that they would have to transfer me to another department and put me on hold while the transfer occurred.

The vendor is asking for proof I have paid from Capitol One, but Capitol One will not give me any proof because of the investigation. Capitol One has told me verbally that they will contact the vendor, but I do n't have any confirmation that they will do so. 

Regarding the Fraud investigation, I have already been on a conference call with Capitol One with my sister XXXX because we believe the source of this issue is that there has been a mix-up with our information. After learning that my card had been closed, XXXX shared with me a letter she received a to her home address in XXXX, XXXX, informing her that she had opened a Capitol One account. XXXX called Capitol One to report that she did not open an account - I opened a Capitol One card in my name with my information, but she received a letter to her address to her name. I live in XXXX, XXXX and did not receive such a letter. 

Here are the outstanding issue that need an immediate response:1.

The charge for this flight was on my XX/XX/XXXX billing statement ( XXXX XXXX ), which again, I paid the balance off in full and shows up on my bank statement. Capitol One needs to pay the vendors with the money I have given them when I paid off my balance in full. 

2. Unpaid Statement : I received a paper statement for XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX with an outstanding balance of {$1300.00}. I can not access this information online, because my account has been closed. Vendors from this statement period have contacted me about payment. Please confirm XXXX things : a. If I pay this balance, will the vendors on this statement be paid? 
b. If I can not pay off this statement balance because the account is under investigation, will it be considered a late payment? Will I be charged interest? I have the means and intention to pay off all outstanding balances in full. 

3. Confirm that the investigation is underway and a time frame for when it will be resolved. I was told that it would take up to two weeks for an investigator to be assigned to the case, which was opened on XXXX XXXX but it has been more than two weeks, and as of today, XXXX XXXX Capitol One said an investigator has not yet been assigned to the case. 

How is it that my sister 's contact information is linked with mine? When I called Capitol One today, they said that the number they had on file to reach me at ended in XXXX.

The person at home called me and was very upset that this unknown agency called my home phone for me and was that rude. So I called XXXX back and he was very RUDE. He did n't want to talk about how he was rude to the person at my home all he would say was he was threatening to file a judgement against me for an old account that is 15 years old ( or older ). The threat of a judgement frightened me cause I want to move and do n't want any negative information on my credit report. He told me that I have good credit ( how could he access my credit report? ). So I wanted to address the issue of him being rude when he called my home first off, that 's when XXXX went on to say well I see you do n't want to pay this bill so I will go forward with this judgement ( with a nasty attitude ). So I asked to speak to his supervisor because he was being so rude. So he put XXXX XXXX ( who claims to be a supervisor ) on the phone and XXXX said I have a {$1700.00} balance on a particular account that needs to be settled and that I can settle it today ( for {$800.00} ) and I said I do n't have that kind of money so he insisted on a payment which I paid {$100.00} on XXXX/XXXX/15 so he said I have until the end of the month to pay another {$700.00} to settle this account and I said I do n't know if I 'm going to have it so he said I will give you until XX/XX/XXXX to pay the {$700.00} if you do n't have it I will give you until XX/XX/XXXX to pay a total of {$1000.00} to settle the account but by XX/XX/XXXX. you have to make another {$350.00} payment so I did make that on XXXX/XXXX/15. So that left I had another {$550.00} to pay by the end of the month. Before that initial phone call I had never heard of ARA nor had they ever sent me any letters for collection and they have never showed me proof of the account that they are collecting for. I called the creditor that I owe today to find out about that account and it 's not in their system and I 'm not surprised cause that was over 15 years ago. I called XXXX and was advised to cancel the {$550.00} check ( which I did cancel it ) and investigate and request further information from ARA about the account they are trying to collect from me. And the XXXX referred me to FTC to file a complaint. Everytime I speak to XXXX he 's threatening me with a judgement if I do n't settle this account ASAP and he wont ' accept anything other than a settlement. I 'm a mother with XXXX kids and I do n't need to be threatened by an agency trying to collect on an account that 's 15 years old. They have collected from me {$450.00}.

181911,2015-08-27,Bank account or service,Checking account,Deposits and withdrawals,,"Chase refused to investigate my complaint of fraudulent activity and credit {$3000.00} to my account as required by the Electronic Funds Transfer Act ( EFTA ). I am a XXXX year old XXXX woman from the XXXX. I have significant student debt and work part-time with a yearly salary of {$6000.00}. Because of Chase 's misconduct, I can not open a bank account at another bank and must rely on a prepaid card to receive wages. I am moving out of state next month and am unable to obtain affordable housing because this negative information is on my credit report. 
On or around XXXX/XXXX/14, I lost my Chase debit card. Shortly after realizing this, I logged on to my mobile account and saw that XXXX unauthorized checks ( {$3000.00} ) were deposited and {$200.00} was withdrawn at an unfamiliar Chase branch ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, see Ex. 1 ). Immediately thereafter, I went to the closest Chase branch ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) and spoke with the teller who informed me the acct. would be closed. 
Despite Chase 's assurance that my account would be closed, on XXXX/XXXX/14 XXXX unauthorized transactions were posted to my account ( see Ex. 1 ) : XXXX ATM withdrawals ( totaling {$1000.00} ) from a Chase branch that I have never visited ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ), and XXXX "" card purchases with cash '' ( totaling {$1800.00} ) from an unfamiliar check cashing store in XXXX. On XXXX/XXXX/14, Chase took {$3000.00} from my account ( see "" deposited item returns '' in Ex. 1 ). On XXXX/XXXX/14, I filed a dispute and received a response from Chase alleging that the withdrawals were authorized ( see Ex. 2 ). As proof, Chase provided me photocopies of the XXXX fraudulent checks endorsed with a forged signature ( see Ex. 3 ). 
Prior to this incident, I had been a loyal Chase customer. Despite this, Chase did not follow the requirements of EFTA in investigating my fraud claim. I believe that Chase may have treated me this way because I am a person XXXX and/or a low income customer. 
Section 909 ( b ) of EFTA states that the burden of proof is on the financial institution to show that the alleged fraudulent transaction was authorized. The OCC Comptroller 's Handbook on EFTA ( XXXX 2014 ) states "" institutions can not assume that they have satisfied their duty to investigate simply by concluding that the customer 's debit card and PIN were used ... .rather, institutions must take steps to investigate whether there are indications that unauthorized use occurred. '' According to EFTA staff commentary ( Supp. I, 12 C.F.R. 205.11 ( c ) ( 4 ) -5 ), information that may be reviewed includes : - The transaction history of the particular account for a reasonable period of time immediately preceding the allegation of error. Previous authorized withdrawals from my account show a pattern of small-dollar ATM withdrawals of less than {$200.00} made once every few days or weeks. There is no pattern of same-day withdrawals of large sums of money ( more than {$1000.00} ). No previous authorized transactions were ever made from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or the XXXX XXXX Chase branch in XXXX. 
- The location of either the transaction or the payee in question relative to the consumer 's place of residence and habitual transaction area. XXXX unauthorized same-day withdrawals ( {$1000.00} ) were made at a Chase branch located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. This branch is located on the other side of the city and over an hour and a half away from my home in the XXXX. 
- Any other information appropriate to resolve the claim. XXXX fraudulent checks were deposited and XXXX unauthorized ATM withdrawals were made at XXXX separate Chase branches ( see Ex. 1 ). Review of the security camera footage would show the transactions were not made by me. 
A review of these items as part of an investigation under EFTA should have shown to Chase that the deposits and withdrawals on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX respectively were fraudulent and unauthorized.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,NY,10473,,Consent provided,Web,08/27/15,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,1540640

I made every month payment timely and was never late. On XX/XX/XXXX, VW announced that they had used "" cheat devices '' in their TDI ( i.e Diesel ) vehicles. The intent of these devices was to violate American environmental standards. In particular, to cheat in meeting NOx emission output. VW immediately imposed a ban on its dealers from selling these effected new and/or used TDI vehicles. As a result, TDI vehicles have certainly lost significant value since VW has n't determined how, or if, the vehicles can be repaired to legally satisfy EPA emission standards. The matter is well know and rather than explain it further, I will instead address my complaint. I made a request to VW Credit to suspend additional loan payments until such time that the EPA accepts the remedy regarding the TDI scandal. I purchased the vehicle based on VW 's claim that the vehicle is a "" Clean Diesel '' that provided efficient use of diesel fuel in delivering the rated MPG along with EPA complaint emissions standards. The sale was based on a lie and fraud on the part of VW. VW themselves do not deny the wrongdoing. I do not want to continue paying for this vehicle until I know that the vehicle satisfies all the conditions and expectations made to me when I purchased the car. 
I cite "" 16 C.F.R. Part 433 : Federal Trade Commission Trade Regulation Rule Concerning the Preservation of Consumers ' Claims and Defenses ( The Holder Rule ). I am presently in a position of having to make continued payments for this vehicle in order to maintain my excellent credit ratings even though the vehicle was sold to me under fraudulent and possibly even criminal intent by the manufacturer VW. In addition, it is unknown if there is a fix for this problem. In effect I am being forced to pay for a what might be a worthless pile of junk to preserve a personal attribute that I 've worked hard to create ( i.e. my credit score ).

This year I went through a few bad personal assistants helping me with my biz and personal, and I got behind in my paperwork. But started feeling a tight money pinch every month.

They put their fee onto my account, which then makes it negative, and everyday, Key bank tries to claim the {$38.00} fee by attempting again, literally snowballing already {$400.00} in just a few days.

The will post date any payment made after the initial bill is paid with their online payment center weeks at a time or even the next billing cycle without the knowledge of the customer. 

The customer may see payments being delayed weeks and even to the next billing cycle. 

A Lowe 's Customer service representative XXXX, XXXX at XXXX XXXX, states it is Lowe 's credit paying practice to post-date any subsequent payment made in a billing cycle to the next billing cycle automatically, and it is solely up to the customer to change the date to immediately. 

They believe it is "" legal '' to purposely post-date a payment a customer makes to the next billing cycle, NOT defaulting to the current date. If a customer happens to miss that they post-dated the payment, they are unconcerned with the matter. 

This poses problems with customers seeing bills they have paid being delayed weeks even up to a month, without their knowledge. Which causes problems with customers tracking bill payments that have failed to post for up to a month. 

Lowe 's attitude towards this is, "" tough luck '' we set up the post dating payment intentionally that way, and it is up to you to figure out that you have change the post dated payment to todays date. 

This only occurs with customer who make multiple payments within a billing cycle. 
This action deliberate on their part can cause late payment fees or insufficient funds fees being placed on a consumer because of their poor billing and payment options.

183610,2015-11-19,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"My mother XXXX XXXX and I are co-owners of our primary residence, which we purchased in XXXX. Then, we had obtained a mortgage from lender Chase for a principal balance of {$380000.00}, and a monthly payment of {$4900.00}. 
In XXXX XXXX, for a number of personal and financial reasons, most of which were temporary, we fell behind on our payments and began the process of applying for a loan modification. ( A foreclosure action was filed against us, but the action was ultimately suspended, as our file was under review for a modification. ) We were finally offered a trial modification in XXXX XXXX and a final HAMP modification two days ago, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
During a time period of almost 7 YEARS, from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX, we were in the process of applying for the modification. We would call Chase, be told that our application was "" under review, '' then be told that our documents expired because the 60-day time period had passed, and we were forced to submit documents all over again. This cycle happened repeatedly. There were also lengthy and numerous delays caused by Chase ( e.g. waiting for their appraiser, etc. ). Importantly, during this time, interest and fees were accruing. 
The final modification we are being offered is for a new principal balance of {$520000.00} and a monthly payment of {$4100.00}. 
Our complaints about Chase are as follows : ( 1 ) The loan modification process took the extraordinarily unreasonable time of 7 years because Chase was not undertaking the modification process in good faith. This is prejudicial to us because interest and fees were accruing on our account during the entire 7-year period. If Chase had shown good faith, including processing our application in a timely manner, we would not have been forced to accumulate the high amount of interest and fees. ( See recent XXXX XXXX, XXXX decision XXXX XXXX Bank, XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX NY Slip Op XXXX, Supreme Court, XXXX XXXX, NY XXXX finding that plaintiff lender failed to negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable resolution pursuant to CPLR XXXX ( f ), in part because lender repeatedly claimed that the modification application was not complete ]. ) ( 2 ) We are unable to afford the new offered monthly payment of {$4100.00}. Our original monthly payment was {$4900.00}, so this new monthly payment is only a savings of {$750.00}. Furthermore, about half of the new payment is to cover our monthly escrow fee, which would not be as high, had we not accumulated so many fees and charges during the 7-year processing period. 
( 3 ) We were not considered for any programs other than HAMP. Per Chase, we were only considered for HAMP, not for any of the XXXX modification programs. As our application showed, our income is relatively high but our documented expenses ( associated with tenants on said property, and with basic living expenses ) are also high and are equal to almost half the value of our income. Chase explained to us that other programs such as XXXX look at both income and expense, whereas HAMP only looks at income. Had we been considered for XXXX of the other programs, which takes into account expenses, we might have been offered a more affordable monthly payment. 
( 4 ) The new principal balance they offer is {$520000.00}, which is higher than the current estimated value of our home. We had sent over to Chase more than XXXX Comparative Market Analysis ( "" CMA '' ) done by a licensed real estate broker that, as of XXXX, estimated the value of our home to be between {$380000.00} to {$400000.00}. 
( 5 ) We are not being given enough time to make a decision. We received the final modification offer on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and are told that a response is due on XXXX XXXX, XXXX.

The offer was accepted in XXXX XXXX and was to go to closing in XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, water pipes in the unoccupied house froze and burst with considerable damage. The sale was put on hold. 
The seller filed an insurance claim and was awarded funds for repairs, which were deposited in the Insurance Claims Department of Chase Bank. 
I renewed my offer. About half of the insurance repair work was completed at that point. The reason the work progressed so slowly was that the contractor hired by the seller became difficult to contact and was dismissed after payment for the work completed. The remaining work was for mold remediation, floors and repair to the heating system. A total of {$14000.00} remained in the insurance claims benefit. At this point, my real estate agent informed me that it would be best to accept the remaining money rather than wait for the repairs to be completed because the house might be placed in foreclosure by Chase. With this understanding a new closing was set. 
When we were assured the sale would take place I contacted a new firm to do the work needed for the insurance repairs along with other rehabilitation work on the house. The seller and his agent contacted Chase Bank to add my name to the account for the insurance claims benefits and I was told the bank agreed to this arrangement. On the day of closing the seller and his agent assured me there would be no problems accessing the insurance claims benefits which would be payable to the seller or his assigns. We closed on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and our contactor began work on XXXX XXXX, XXXX.

XXXX XXXX at that number said he was in the Checking Department. He told me to call XXXX. Whoever answered that number told me to call XXXX, where, XXXX XXXX told me to call XXXX Customer Service at XXXX. At this number, XXXX XXXX referred me to "" XXXX '' in XXXX XXXX. 
'' XXXX '' informed me that "" A VP wrote a letter saying the insurance money was not included in the short sale so Chase would keep the money. '' She said the letter was sent on XXXX XXXX ( a Sunday ) to an address in Arizona. 
'' XXXX '' then forwarded my call to XXXX XXXX in the Insurance Claims Department who told me she needed documentation that the insurance settlement was to be forwarded to me. 
Realizing that this is where the conversation started. I closed the phone call.

I have legal XXXX family house, and according to conforming limit in our area my loan amount can not exceed {$800000.00}, which if way above of my outstanding loan amount. 
I 'm single mother with teenager daughter living and maintaining this house after my divorce. During the divorce proceeds house was left to me and my daughter, and court ordered me to complete assumption within one year. 

My current mortgage is much higher than my property value because we bought this house on the peak of the real estate market and during the recession value of my house has dropped. As of XX/XX/XXXX, my outstanding unpaid balance around {$520000.00} and deferred principal balance {$57000.00}, and my house marker value around {$540000.00}.

I do not see any valuable reasons for Chase to decline me for loan assumption when I 'm a good Chase customer who never miss or been late on mortgage payments.

To finance my education, I paid with a mix of federal and private loans, as well as my personal finances. My private loans were issued through Wells Fargo Bank ( although I had come to Wells Fargo through XXXX ). After applying for my loans, I never received any correspondence from Wells Fargo. I was given no account information to view my loans online, and even when I tried to track this information down online by entering other personal information, like Social Security number, birthdate, first and last name, their online system could not link me to any account ( which I find odd considering almost every other banking institution can retrieve your account information from your personal information filled out in your account applications ). 

Having never taken out student loans previously, I was not completely understanding of how the process worked. Since my loans were then issued and distributed through XXXX University 's financial aid office, I did n't suspect any issues or negligence on the part of the bank. 

My loans will soon fall out of their grace period next month, and after having still not been contacted by Wells Fargo, I called to find out any information. In speaking with several loan service officers, I learned I DO in fact have an account number, which had never been given to me through any correspondence.

I have now accrued nearly {$10000.00} in interest that I was never notified of, and the bank accepts culpability for mailing loan disclosure agreements to the wrong address and for also failing to EVER correspond with me through email so that I could access my online account.

The property was previously in a foreclosure proceeding, therefore my attorneys contacted the bank 's attorneys XXXX to obtain a payoff amount. A payoff letter was sent to my attorney XX/XX/2015. This payoff figure was confirmed by the title closer on the day of closing. 

Approximately three weeks after the closing, I contacted the new owners of the property to determine if any mail was still being sent to my old address. Inspection of the mail I received resulted in my locating a letter sent by regular mail from Seterus ( the debt collector processing my loan ). This letter included the payoff check which was sent to them by the title closer to payoff the loan. The letter stated that the check was being returned because payoff amount was insufficient. 

I immediately contacted my attorney and the title closer. I returned the check to the title closer and called Seterus to determine what happened. The Seterus agent indicated that they had sent a different payoff amount to my address XXXX ( the same date as the letter that was sent to my attorney from their attorneys - XXXX ). When I tried to ascertain how the matter could be resolved the agent said I would have to send a complaint to a fax number, and wait for someone to contact me. The agent also mentioned that interest in the amount of $ XXXX/day would be accumulating. When I tried to determine how long the resolution process would take, no time could be provided. 

There has been significant misrepresentation by Seterus in this matter. I believe this misrepresentation amounts to fraud. Seterus asserts that they sent a payoff statement to me XX/XX/XXXX in a larger amount than that sent to my attorney - a copy of this letter is attached to the statement they sent to my attorney XX/XX/2015 

If the larger payoff amount was on the Seterus record XX/XX/2015 as they suggest, why did the Seterus agent quote the smaller payoff amount to the title closer XX/XX/2015 the day of the closing ( a note to that effect was made by the title closer at closing, see attached ). The evidence suggests, that they recalculated after the closing, and created backdated documents to support their position. This company should not be allowed to do business. If your loan is sold to this company, you are in trouble. 

This company has a long standing record as a bad actor in the mortgage processing business.

XXXX representatives from PayPal confirmed that my Social Security Number, Date of Birth and order of my first and last name did not match their records. 
The first representative verified me with the account number, balance and last charges. This took XXXX minutes to get to this point. That representative confirmed that the charge was from {$25.00} charge for a service I intended to pay on my credit card. PayPal opened and billed a line of credit for instead of using the credit card I had registered on the account. I had to hold for an unspecified period to be connected with some XXXX in PayPal collections, as apparently the phone number on their written bill is different than the XXXX they use for collections. I had to go to an appointment, so I could not hold. 
I called back and had the same issues with verification. I was put through to the collections department, who was willing to accept payment on the account, but no handle my dispute of the fees ( XXXX times the principal ), because they could not verify my identity. 
They even took my credit card number. A less sophisticated consumer may have given up and paid the bill to clean up their credit and avoid the hassle. 
I asked for supervisor XXXX times. The representative continued to explain why a supervisor could not help me. I then had to resort to shouting down the representative on the hope that either he would hangup or get me to the supervisor. 
The supervisor took the payment and credited the account. He waived the fees. It was interesting that he was able to verify me with the date of birth no one else, including XXXX tries on the automated system could verify. 
How can can a company open an account with a wrong social security number, phone number, possible date of birth and email address? 
How can you charge some XXXX fees on such a loan when that entity lacks sufficient information to identify the person they are loaning money to. How can you be willing to accept payment on an account, but then not properly service the account? The supervisor did not seem concerned with this, which indicates the corporation condones this conduct. 
He, however, was concerned that I had to shout down the rep the speak with the supervisor. 
That being said I felt treated unfairly and harassed by the whole process. The need to shout and argue my way to a supervisor. 
They only use first names. The XXXX representative and the supervisor, both identified themselves with the same first name. The other first names were generic. If this was a litigated matter PayPal could use my inability to properly identify the exact staff members as a weakness in my claim. 
To the best of my recollection only the supervisor advised me that this was an attempt to collect by a debt collector and that any information discussed would be used for that purpose.",,"Paypal Holdings, Inc",NY,14228,,Consent provided,Web,08/21/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1524807

Ultimately I wanted to send this money to my sons account with Paypal. Each day I checked the balance on my Paypal account which was {$0.00} until I checked on XXXX XXXX XXXX, when the balance showed as {$230.00}. So I initiated a transfer of these funds from my Paypal account to my sons paypal account. Later that day I happened to be on line looking at my XXXX XXXX Accounts and I noticed that the {$230.00} had been taken from my savings account but had also been taken from my checking account. I was upset because I had instructed the {$230.00} to only come out of my savings and did not know why the {$230.00} was also taken from my checking account. Luckily this {$230.00} coming out of my checking account without my knowledge could have resulted in an overdraw but did n't. When I called Paypal the representative told me that they took the XXXX {$230.00} because the original {$230.00} had n't actually cleared when I initiated the transfer to my son. I asked if the {$230.00} had n't yet cleared from my XXXX XXXX Account savings account, based on my transfer on XXXX XXXX, then why did Paypal show that I had a {$230.00} available balance. I also wanted to know how did Paypal then manage to get the second {$230.00} from my XXXX XXXX Checking on the same day, and why did n't they take the XXXX {$230.00} from my savings account and not my checking, all without my prior approval or even notification. The rep did not have an answer so I asked to be transferred to a supervisor, which he said he would do. I waited on the phone in a queue for quite a while and then was cut off and hung up on. I called again later in the day and spoke to a Paypal Supervisor, XXXX, in their office in the XXXX. He agreed that it was a problem that the system showed the funds as being available and then let me transfer the money, and that it was a problem that the second {$230.00} was taken without my approval. He said that he was submitting a trouble/problem ticket and that I will receive an email acknowledging this. I never received an email so I went on line and submitted an online email complaint. I received the email shown below so I responded saying that I would have to file a complaint with a regulatory agency.

I called Navient to ask if they could either lower the monthly payments, postpone them until after school, or put them in forbearance for at least a few months so that I could try to find a solution. I was told that they had no option for financial hardship, and I would either have to pay, or my account would go into default. What? XXXX XXXX, as awful as they are, at least have a program for financial hardship, that allows you to put your account into forbearance for a maximum of 12 months. The woman on the phone was not only rude, but then started lecturing me about how it should n't be so difficult to come up with the money, and that I could ask family and friends to just give it to me, and that my payment really was n't that much anyway. I explained that my rent is $ XXXX ( which is cheap in XXXX ), and that bills, food, etc. were already over what I was making, and that I was barely able to cover the basic minimum.

I took all of the necessary and required steps to report this fraud to Navient who now manages the loan. The investigator in the Navient Fraud Department assigned to my case is named XXXX. She is in a position to determine whether a loan now worth nearly {$25000.00} - fraudulently attached to my name - is to be removed from my record ; she has been dishonest and incompetent. She made the decision to deny my fraud claim without ever contacting me even once to discuss any of the evidence or circumstances involved in the case. 
I called her today ( Thursday XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and many of the things that she told me on the phone made it clear that she has not reviewed or considered many of the facts of this case. For example, she told me that all of the information on the loan application form was accurate, when this is obviously and demonstrably false : the phone number, e-mail, and employment information given on the form are all falsified. When I pointed this out to her, she would not address it. She said to me "" I called the number of your employer listed on the loan application form, and I got a voicemail greeting with your name. '' This is not only false, but impossible. Not only have I had no professional affiliation with that employer XX/XX/XXXX, but when I did work for them, I was XXXX, and I never had a phone number or voicemail linked to their company. What she said was a complete lie. 
The person who stole my identity also opened a loan with another bank. That bank investigated the fraud, determined it was valid, and ruled in my favor ; they removed me from the account. When I tried to present this fact to XXXX as evidence that there is an obvious precedent for the fraud perpetrated against me by the borrower, she told me that this was irrelevant to the case. 
When I told her that I had incriminating text messages from the perpetrator of the crime in which he indicates that he has indeed committed fraud against me, XXXX told me that this was also irrelevant and would not effect her decision. 
When I asked her specifically whether, in her expert opinion, the signature on the loan application form in any way resembles any of the multitude of signature examples that I submitted to her, she again implied that this was irrelevant. 
Her justification for disregarding all of these things was because 1. I did not report the fraud immediately once I discovered it, and 2. I both made and received phone calls with the lender discussing the status of the loan and the payment history of the loan before reporting the fraud. Neither of these things provide any legal standing for her to deny my fraud claim and to not investigate it properly.

The physical location was a phone at a local CVS store.

I asked how that could be and she gave the example that if I decided to wait another day to complete the transaction, the fee could be higher. I said I wanted to complete the transaction now ; would the fee be {$5.00}? She replied that the fee should be {$5.00}, but that they were required to read the disclaimer.

The Ford Dealer and the Company Ford Credit discriminate me by my national origins offer me XXXX flipped loans with terms that are less favorable, like a higher interest rate. 
The company flipped my cars 3 times and the last time it was a lease .I got a Ford Explorer XXXX for 24 months lease terms. 
The payments were very high at the end of my Lease after 24 months Ford Credit told me that I have 36 months. I asked them that it was not what I signed it in the Ford Dealer. 
The Ford dealer closed it. Now Ford Credit has those Predatory Lending contract with the 12 months added by the dealer that now it is not in Business for fraud and malpractices. The Dealer represents Ford Company as a Franchise. Ford Credit has the predatory lending contracts. I am paying for every month to Ford Credit, not to the Dealer. 
The company offer me in market the same car a Ford Explorer with a lease for 24 months for {$220.00} per month. My lease was 24 month for {$470.00} per month and also the Ford Dealer and Ford Credit added another year.I am paying almost XXXX around 50 % interest compare with the prices in the market.

I opened an XXXX account for my minor daughter so that she would have access to limited funds on a debit card. The card and the account were used sparingly. When my daughter attempted to make a teller cash withdrawal on XXXX XXXX, 2015, she and I were advised by bank staff that our account was overdrawn in the amount of {$1800.00}. We subsequently learned that my daughter was unaware that she had lost the debit card and that XXXX counterfeit checks were deposited to the account. Whomever perpetrated this fraud capitalized on the fact that immediate credit was provided by TD at the time of deposit. ATM withdrawals were then executed against the account over a 12 day span. Once we were aware that the card had been lost and the account compromised, we filed an unauthorized electronic transaction claim with TD. At the request of bank investigator 's, a police report was filed with the XXXX XXXX Police Department. 

In explicably, TD Bank has denied our claim, citing as the basis for its decision, the fact that no additional transactions were attempted after the checks deposited were returned as counterfeits and because the transactions were consistent with our normal usage pattern. XXXX 's actions in this matter are a flagrant violation of Reg E and raise a question as to whether it 's policies in this area are in conformance with the requirements of the regulation.

I want to emphasize that the unauthorized transactions were all conducted in XXXX, NJ. My daughter and I reside in XXXX, XXXX, New York. Neither of us has ever recorded a bank transaction in XXXX, nor did we transact in the amounts and frequency noted for the fraudulent transactions. Moreover, there is no significance of the fact that unauthorized activity on the account ceased after there were no longer available funds. 

Reg E requires that a financial institution have evidence that a covered transaction or transactions which form the basis of a consumer claim were not unauthorized if it is to deny the call for reimbursement. TD Bank has no such evidence and the inaccurate and absurd reasons it offers to unlawfully deny my claim is behavior that warrants an examination by the CFPB.",,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,NY,11357,,Consent provided,Web,06/18/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1427738

I always check my digital email receipt of the wells transaction and my physical loan mailing update to make sure all is ok. 

A week ago, M & T calls me to tell me I have overdraft charges. I assumed my automatic transfer of {$580.00} from XXXX XXXX to M & T failed. But it worked and my loan was paid up to date. I asked "" how do I have an overdraft then? "". Them "" well you did n't pay the fee '' Me. "" what fee? 

Basically, they created a {$15.00} "" under {$500.00} '' fee on my account that I was required to have. They may have sent snail mail to me but I have a XXXX ratio of junk mail from them so I only read my mortgage mail. My mortgage was up to date.

After I informed him we did n't deal with that kind of people, either, he finally got down to business.

Now we finally get to sign our papers and just leave.

Negotiations and court appearances were held to get out of foreclosure. The bank 's lawyer wanted compensation of {$100000.00} for legal fees. 

By XX/XX/XXXX, the amount to be repaid was agreed and negotiations for legal fees were finalizing. Funds were sitting in an escrow account waiting to be sent to TD Bank. A few months later my brother XXXX unexpectedly. The Estate 's attorney made clear that the Estate ( and myself ) would abide by the agreement and were eager to get the building back because that 's what my brother wanted. The Estate continued and still continues to pay all property taxes, utilities, and maintenance. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, our lawyer found out that TD Bank sold the note to a private party at a discount to what we had agreed to pay. We were never formally notified. The note buyer said that the TD Bank loan officer told him that the note was being sold because we did not have the money to pay it back. That is not true. Why were we shut out when we had a pending agreement with TD Bank? Why were we paying upkeep of the building if we were not serious about the agreement? 

This has been a horrific year for me, made worse being dragged through this foreclosure process. Our lawyer has been very frustrated ; he is not sure his communication and offers to the bank went past the bank 's outside counsel. And just this morning I heard that the note buyer wants XXXX what was owed the bank if I want to buy it. 

I would appreciate your help in investigating the handling of this foreclosure. Why was a note ( and the building ) sold at a discount when there was an owner ready to pay more? Was something done illegally and against proper banking procedure?",,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,NY,11566,,Consent provided,Web,04/17/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1335344

When he came back on the phone he backtracked and was explaining that I owed money for various amounts and that is what took my payment 'down ' to {$120000.00}. Again he backtracked when I told him that this was not what he said. I then asked him how I owed money if I made a lump payment of {$13000.00} which pays me forward through the end of XXXX or early XXXX. He then began to tell me that I owed 'simple interest ' on the loan ; I explained that simple interest on a {$1600.00} balance could not be the {$700.00} interest payment that they say that I owed. This would mean that I accrued {$700.00} in interest on a {$1600.00} from XXXX XXXX until XXXX XXXX. Since I did not feel that he provided an adequate explanation for this amount, I requested that he send me a written explanation detailing the reasons why I am late with my payment though I made a lump payment of {$13000.00} in XXXX. I never received that letter but I continued to receive telephone calls from Santander representatives who could not explain the reason that I owed money but who would simply state that I owed 'simple interest. ' I would request something in writing during each conversation about monies owed but I never would receive anything in writing. Instead I would receive a telephone call demanding payment. Yesterday I informed the Santander representative who called me that I wanted XXXX things to be done : 1 ) written explanation of why they stated that I owe money at this time 2 ) cease-and-desist from calling me. I told her that I did not want them to call me anymore because I am not getting the help that I need and that they were not following through with providing written documentation that I am requesting during the telephone conversation. She promised me XXXX things : 1 ) an emailed billing explanation TODAY which was yesterday 2 ) no more telephone calls. I waited again for her to provide email documentation regarding any monies owed but I never have received anything.

197785,2015-10-07,Credit reporting,,Incorrect information on credit report,Public record,"I disputed with Experian multiple times concerning the false public records being reported to my credit history. I explained that the public records are identity theft and filed a police report and Id Theft Affidavit. I called Experian and they said that because it is a matter of public record they cant do anything to rectify the situation. Experian Also explained that I was to take my actions to the XXXX Bankruptcy court and ask them to remove these Bankruptcy filings and unauthorized inquiries from my credit history. 

It is my hope to get this Identity Theft issue resolved once and for all but to this day I am still receiving unwanted unauthorized inquiries on my credit report. I have never been in a bankruptcy and I have never filed bankruptcy ever ; I would like to get these public records deleted from my credit history so they stop causing me hardship. 

Experian states that these bankruptcy remarks are a matter of public record and can not be removed unless through the data furnisher itself. Which is why I went to the XXXX Bankruptcy court and obtained a copy of the bankruptcy filings. That is when I noticed that the bankruptcy filings Experian is now reporting on my credit file contain inaccurate information that is clearly not me. My name was spelled wrong on both bankruptcy filings and the social security number is not even valid. It is clear to me that I am a victim of an impostor playing harsh pranks on me and that Experian is reporting false public records of someone else who did a bankruptcy filing. 

The bankruptcy court will not allow for me to remove these public records stating that I must first verify the identity of the person on the filing. This is impossible because my name is not the person on the filing so can not be verified for the XXXX Bankruptcy Court to expunge from the records. 

As you can see no matter which way I turn for help to remove the Bankrupcy Public filings they are still being reported. Experian reports false information that I am unable to remove from the bankruptcy court records. 

I am not sure why removing the false records would cause anyone harm because the bankruptcy items being reported were dismissed bankruptcy filings that never went to fruition. The only person receiving grief from the incident is me as I would be rejected from additional credit providers due to having filed bankruptcy. Creditors do not care that it was dismissed they only care it was filed and reject my credit applications instantly for that fact alone. This information is damaging me and must be rectified somehow.

198425,2015-11-09,Credit reporting,,Unable to get credit report/credit score,Problem getting report or credit score,"3 years ago, I went to XXXX bank to open a checking account ( keep in mind I had never had a credit card ). At this time, it was discovered that there was already a credit card account under my social security number at XXXX. This was how we first found the fraud. The nice man at XXXX bank was very helpful and we met about XXXX more times to resolve the issue. At the time, It was not evident if the identity theft was intentional or if someone had accidently entered my social security number. Regardless, XXXX fixed this in their systems, canceled the other guys credit card, and allowed me to open my first checking account with XXXX under my rightful social security number. When I applied for the credit card, it was understood that I would have to wait a couple months because the "" incident '' put a fraud alert on my credit/social security account. When the time passed, I reached out to all XXXX of the credit agencies ( XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax ) to follow up regarding my credit and get my credit report. Little did I know, this was the start of a 3 year battle trying to see that report. 
From that day forward, I have been trying to get help getting my credit report. Getting a HUMAN on the phone with these credit agencies is nearly impossible. Not only are there a plethora of different numbers and departments to call, but every single time you call, you get connected to an automated robot, which then they offer you a long list of Numeral options that are vague and confusing and within each have a web of more options until you reach the end of XXXX and it either A ) HANGS UP or B ) Does not give you any option that fits what you are looking for and you get automatically disconnected or C ) instructs you to "" go online and fill out XXXX form or mail to XXXX address ''. The very rare times that you do get connected to a HUMAN, every single single exact time, the individual has directed me elsewhere ... ..elsewhere meaning the following options : A ) Another ROBOT B ) a website or C ) another person who eventually passes me along as well ( repeat and repeat ... ). 
Now let 's talk about why the website option is not helpful. When I first called to follow up regarding my credit and the fraud with the agencies 3 years ago, that was the first place they directed me to Request my credit report - through the website. So I do that and after putting in all of my information and answering the questions and after I hit "" Submit '' a message of some variation of this would follow : '' We can not identify your account based on the information you provided, please call or mail the following information to this address '' or "" ERROR -- we can not access this page. Please call this number XXXX ''. There is some type of block on my account that does not allow ANYONE to access it within the system. That is why whenever I try to get help online, I am always blocked before getting to the next step because my information appears invalid and then I am directed to call a number. And when I get someone on the phone and they try to help, they always come to a dead end where they can not access any information for me about my account because some type of error pops up that blocks them out. 
I have called each of the agencies countless of times through the years, filled out forms, requests, complaints, mailed in packages of personal information including tax returns, utility bills I pay, my rent bill, a copy of my social security card, my license, passport, XXXX, however I always get the same notice and response -- that they can not identify me and to please send more information or call some other number. So the bottom line 3 years later is that no one CAN ACCESS MY ACCOUNT AND NOONE KNOWS HOW TO FIX IT. I call the agencies -- they tell me to go elsewhere or the bureaus.

I returned the car to the dealership, returned the plates to the DMV, and contacted the auto insurance company.

I was not informed by Ally when I initially contacted them that I would be responsible for this sum. I was not informed that I may want to keep the vehicle, pay the lease payments ( which would have totaled about {$10000.00} over the remaining 20 months of the lease ). 
If I was aware of this I would have kept the car, made the lease payments and driven it through the lease period. 
Now the bank gets just about the entire term of the lease paid to them but was able to repossess and then sell the vehicle at a much higher residual value than it would have had had it been returned to them at the end of the original lease period.

Our mortgage was with XXXX XXXX and then XXXX. With XXXX, in XXXX, my husband incurred an injury that required surgery and recovery time. During that time we never missed a mortgage payment. However we did miss a quarterly property tax payment. In XXXX XXXX XXXX sent us a letter that we had defaulted on our loan. We contacted them immediately to work out a way to catch up on the taxes ( still continuing to pay the mortgage payment ). At the time, they were very nice saying they had a whole department to help people like us and they would work with us to give us a loan modification. 
I submitted all paperwork and I continued to pay my monthly mortgage. In XXXX XXXX, XXXX told me to stop paying my mortgage. They said I no longer had a loan and my payments were not going toward my house. They never returned any payments I made either. I stopped paying. 
This dragged out for years as I was shifted to different people. With every shift I would start all over again. They still sent me monthly statements. XXXX I tried to pay my bill ( to show that I could and wanted to. ) They refused my payment XXXX times.

This information is in my opinion not fully disclosed or understood by the consumer. This is a Penalty of huge magnitude for any payment made within the grace period. 
They do not charge a late fee if received within the grace period, BUT instead charge a PER DIEM amount within the grace period i.e. a Penalty, which can be XXXX or XXXX times higher depending on your principal balance owed XXXX Imagine a check lost in mail-per diem x 40 days because you will not know until next statement ). Where is the consumer protection and advocacy board. I stumbled on this when I notice that my principal amount owed is about XXXX more than I expected. I did not ask for the loan assignment nor did I sign any mortgage agreement with Nationstar. I did not notice this change in terms and my principal over the past couple of years has not changed according to the payment because fraudulent and deceptive practice concerning the grace period - Per diem Hidden Penalties and Fees. 
1. Every credit card must show the balance if not paid in full and also provide interest and penalties paid monthly and a forward look at future payments if the full balance is not paid in full. We are paying in full. 
The mortgage does not disclose this hidden penalty and in this electronic age, you think you are on time when in reality you are paying a penalty XXXX Times the interest rate of the loan. You will never pay off the loan even if you pay the full amount due within the grace period. No DISCLOSURE. This in fact HIDES the per diem interest as normal interest paid jus like you are paying off your loan. The mortgage company does NOT disclose this, so as a consumer, you pay the bill electronically never realizing the hidden fees are being charged at XXXX times the original loan rate PER day XXXX in my case 32.20 % approaching load sharking ). It is not the money, but the selecting the date of payment can cause you to go bankrupt. In effect a PENALTY AND INTEREST PENALTY IN HUGE MAGNITUDE. The LOAN OFFICER on the phone gave me an example of another client paying her loan off by the grace period over the full term of the loan and still owed XXXX in principal because of the per diem fee/PENALTY, which are actually LATE FEES charged on any money payments made within the grace period.

205007,2015-11-10,Credit reporting,,Incorrect information on credit report,Account status,"I have a subscription with Experian, and there is information on my report which seems inappropriate and counterintuitive. Background : Until last week, I had an open, non-mortgage loan with the Federal Government, and this loan was listed on my credit report as an item that was hurting my credit score. I have since paid off [ early ] the entire loan, and this has finally been recognized on my credit report, as my score went up slightly. However, I still have the same number of negative items ( 3 ) on my credit report. XXXX items have n't changed for a long time, but now there is a new "" negative '' item that is hurting my score - "" NOT having an open, non-mortgage loan! '' So, now my score is apparently negatively impacted by NOT having an open, non-mortgage loan. Until last week, HAVING such an open loan was the negative item. I contacted Experian about this, asking how having such a loan could be negative while now I have a negative item by not having such a loan. Experian replied by saying that it 's not a credit bureau but, rather, an online provider of reports, scores, and credit monitoring. I replied to them with a screenshot of their home page, which contains a link to purchase a "" XXXX-Credit Bureau report '' ( since Experian is apparently not a Credit Bureau, I imagine that the report on Experian 's home page pertains to XXXX other agencies. In this era, so many decisions - some moderately important, some critically important - hinge on one 's credit report/score, and I feel that, as a consumer, I should be entitled to know the extent to which items on my credit report are either increasing or decreasing that very crucial metric, known as the credit score. Instead, I receive a suggestion to contact a credit counseling agency. I have no idea how an arbitrary credit counseling service would be able to explain Experian 's methodology to me, let alone why having an open, non-mortgage loan would have a negative impact while, now, NOT having an open, non-mortgage loan would have a negative impact. Why ca n't consumers know how the credit score is calculated when this score can literally shape a person 's life.

My belief is that this goes against all principles of HAMP. Was n't the program put in place to make the mortgage payments more affordable? Why did Wells Fargo have the authority so hide my approval for a modification from me when this would have helped me out financailly. I was forced to refinance on my own and it cost me a great deal of money which I would not have had to spend if Wells Fargo informed me I was actually approved by XXXX XXXX for a modification. Also, if XXXX XXXX owns my mortgage and is the enforcer for Hamp how does Wells Fargo have the right to just decide to override what they say and not communicate with me their findings. In speaking with XXXX XXXX 's escalation team the also sent a complaint to Wells Fargo but Wells Fargo only states that I was making payments so they did not offer me the modification. How many others has Wells Fargo possibly affected by not disclosing to the customers that they were acatually approved for a modification. Wells Fargo continued to hide this from me even when I asked for reviews of my file. If they felt like they were justified in not offering me the modifcation why did they never communicate to me that I was approved by XXXX XXXX? Why did I have to dig this information up on my own.

This last overdraft I received because I moved XXXX $ from my standard checking to my son 's Hassle Free account. The reason my account over drew in the first place two days ago was because of the fees debited by Key Bank. On the ledger there is no sign of overdraft before the fees were debited. In response to the overdraft complaint yesterday, Key Bank sent a tutorial with a fictitious person named XXXX who is XXXX XXXX and very young. The tutorial says that she over drew her account buying coffee and donuts. Besides the very problematic racialization of XXXX, Key Bank blames the customer when actually what is happening is that Key Bank alters the timing of debits and credits in ways that incur overdrafts. My ledger shows several deposits in the last few days yet they mysteriously move around in the ledger as do debits. Once an overdraft is debited in accounts that are fragile ( meaning no overdraft protection attached and low balances ) these fees throw the account into disarray resulting in yet more overdraft fees. Please CFP look carefully at my account. I am not some crazy person continuing to complain. I am an educated woman who follows her account diligently and I am going to continue to complain because I know if this is happening to me, it 's happening to others who perhaps do not have the money to pay the fees.

Now these are my questions, how come the Seterus could n't give me any information about my account when I was told by XXXX that all my questions or concerns would be answered by Seterus since my loan was transferred over. How come the Rep was so rude and could n't get me a manager on the phone and tell me anything about my account, how much I owed, when was my next payment. This sounds very fishy and I do n't want my loan account with Seterus. 
The reason why this is important is because I am in the midst of selling my apt and have a potential selling date by XXXX XXXX and have an additional fee that I owe for the sell of the apt that will be paid at the time of the closing and I do n't want to see surprising fees from Seterus. I need to know what my payments are now so that there are no surprises at the time of the closing. As a consumer, if my loan is transferred to Seterus, Seterus should have all the information ready for me when I called and not give me the run around and then say a manager is not available and that they can not access my loan information. Right now this is frustrating as I need this information. What are my rights as a consumer in regards to getting this information without having to wait for a welcome packets from Seterus. My other question is, "" why is did XXXX Bank transfer my loan to a new company and I have no say about the transfer. Why did XXXX Bank wait less than 2 weeks to inform me about this transfer. '' My account number with Seterus is XXXX and their phone number is XXXX.

Today my husband and I decided to apply for a mortgage and after checking my credit history, I was told that my score is XXXX because I have {$41.00} outstanding as part of collections on that account.

I have never received notice of collections related to this account. Furthermore, I have done everything in my power to close the through TD Bank and was misinformed throughout the entire process.

When I called to discuss this change, they advised that they are allowed by law to hold a 2 month cushion, which I understand. However, when I did an escrow analysis, I determined that they were overstating the shortfall by over {$500.00} because they were *paying* my homeowners insurance, town and school taxes one month before they are due, resulting in over {$500.00} of the shortage. I called and asked how they could pay the bills before they are even sent out, and they replied that the wanted to "" make sure the homeowner was not late with a payment ''. While this sounds wonderful, it allows them to hold {$540.00} of my money in escrow in addition to the {$1100.00} cushion, which is {$540.00} that is not available to earn money for me. For example, my homeowners insurance premium is not due until XX/XX/XXXX, but the escrow statement notes that the payment is sent in XX/XX/XXXX. If Carrington does this for only XXXX mortgages, that 's XXXX XXXX in their bank account instead of the home owner 's account. XXXX recently sold XXXX mortgages to this company.

I asked the specialist why CHASE would do this if the tenant or XXXX did not complain of any fraud and especially since CHASE has already received the funds from the tenant account. The representative advised me she does not see any information the funds was in CHASE possession or in my account she advised she believed the funds was still with XXXX, however my tenant did confirm with XXXX XXXX XXXX that the funds were in fact paid or withdrawn from her account on Friday XXXX XXXX, 2015 to CHASE Bank.

1. A valid and honorable XXXX XXXX XXXX check from my tenant was deposited by myself to my CHASE account XXXX and neither my tenant nor XXXX XXXX XXXX is claiming any fraudulent activity after 8 days has past.

212880,2015-06-16,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"I became the guardian of my Aunt several months before she passed away. My aunt suffered a XXXX as well as incurring XXXX in the last several months of her life, she passed away at XXXX years old. My aunt had several accounts set up with Key Bank, each account had designated PODs ( paid upon deaths ), so when she past away, those accounts would not have to go thru probate, and they would pass on her designated beneficiaries. She had this set up with a few banks. 

While my Aunt was sick, I had to invoke the power attorney, and visited each bank branch she was dealing with and provided them with the Power of Attorney paperwork. A Key Bank manager in the XXXX office placed me on my Aunt 's main checking account as a joint owner, without seeking my aunt 's approval or signature. At the time, I did n't realize how big of an issue this was. 

When my Aunt passed away, I was appointed as the executor her estate. When I went to each bank with my Aunt 's death certificate, I found out the Key Bank had inadvertently deleted all the POD names on several accounts. I provided Key Bank with the original account setup and POD names, which matched the POD names that were currently showing on each monthly statement. Key Bank would not accept this, and told me I had to go to court and suit them to get access to the monies. 
So I engaged an attorney, spent several thousand dollars to go thru the courts, to get a judge to give Key Bank a court order to release the monies to the original POD beneficiaries. 
Once the court order was filed, Key Bank removed the funds from each account, which resulted in each account balance becoming {$0.00}, this was back in XXXX of 2014. I asked Key Bank to close the accounts, back in XX/XX/XXXX. 
I continued to get monthly statements showing {$0.00} balance. 
Back in XX/XX/XXXX of this year, XX/XX/XXXX 's statement now showed a {$25.00} service fee. I immediately called Key Bank and asked again for my deceased Aunt 's accounts to be closed. They told me I had to visit a branch office. 
That same day, I visited the branch office and spoke with the branch manager, who in turn told me I could not close the accounts at the branch, I must close them over the phone. 
I left the branch manager with my phone number and email address and asked them to stop the run around they have been putting me through, and call me to straighten this out. 
The manager said she would call Key Bank legal department and get back to me to straighten this out. 
She never called me back. 
I receive a XX/XX/XXXX Key Bank statement now showing another {$25.00} service fee, for a total of {$50.00}. I ignored it. 
The other day I got XX/XX/XXXX 's statement, showing another {$25.00}, for a total of {$75.00} in fees, and a note that they are closing the account and have contacted a collection agency to collect the {$75.00} from me. The same day, I received a letter from the collection agency. 
I called Key Bank 's main number the following day, and they promised they would straighten this out. I am still waiting for a return call. 

During this process, Key Bank has lost my personal information that they made copies of, and have cost me thousands of dollars in attorney fees, not to mention countless hours of time on the phone, traveling to branch office and aggravation. 

Now I have a collection agency chasing me for fees on accounts that were to be shut downs months ago, which could have an affect on my credit rating, which can affect my business.",,KEYCORP,NY,120XX,,Consent provided,Web,06/16/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1423232
212883,2015-06-06,Bank account or service,Checking account,Deposits and withdrawals,,"Please be advised I have experienced or is experiencing some discriminatory practice from CHASE Banking branch located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NY XXXX ; from an apparent overzealous loss prevention Manger against myself a XXXX CHASE banking customer/member with no past or previous record of loss or fraud with CHASE Bank or any other Bank for that matter. 
Over the years anytime I decide to deposit a check at this particular branch to my checking account # XXXX it is always held up for what amounts to no reason, the process is usually put through loss prevention and fraud faze where I have to wait for an unfair amount of days until this branch / loss Mgr has no more legal right to hold the funds. In other words they do not release the funds willingly or voluntarily even though they have proof there was no misconduct ; there is just no more legal excuse for them to hold on to it which they are then compelled/forced to release funds to customer. 
This newest incident started on XXXX XXXX 2015, at XXXX when I deposited a check from a tenant for {$3500.00}. CHASE originally credited me an incremental {$200.00} advanced credit on the deposit as per there policy of funds availability, however the overzealous loss prevention manager reversed this and put the deposit into some kind of fraudulent activity which reversed the incremental {$200.00} credit and cause my account to be overdrawn as I had used a portion of the available {$200.00}. 
I have been banking with CHASE for over XXXX years ; I also own a home in XXXX ( XXXX ) and rent to tenants that make direct electronic payments and check payments to this same account during the same time period so CHASE is well aware of this kind of activity to my account. 
On XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2015 after receiving and alert on my mobile phone through the CHASE mobile online banking App installed on said phone, that my account was overdrawn, at which point I called CHASE Banking at approximately XXXX, to inquire of the reason for the overdrawn account ; the initial CHASE representative could not figure out the reason why the {$3500.00} deposit was being "" Held '' as it is current status indicated on my account. So he connected me to who I believe was a CHASE online banking loss prevention manager by the name of "" XXXX '' she was pleasant ; but she could only confirm the reason the check was being held was because "" the tenant banked at "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' and was paying me for the very XXXX time '', so therefore the local Loss prevention manager at XXXX XXXX XXXX branch saw a fraud issue with this scenario I 'm supposing. 
I asked if CHASE felt there was some fraud why did n't they notify the person that made out the check and XXXX XXXX XXXX, the online loss manager XXXX replied "" CHASE does not do that ''. I surmised this local Loss manager at XXXX XXXX XXXX branch would only erroneously assume fraud based on my background of being a minority since I have no criminal history or any fraud issues with any bank ; and that this manager totally disregard common sense and my history of receiving rent payments from various tenants over the past XXXX years on my banking record. 
XXXX also advised me I would not get any credit for the deposit until XXXX XXXX 2015, a full XXXX business days after I had made the initial deposit. I find this behavior by CHASE unfair and punitive and without just or reasonable cause. CHASE branch located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, is also the only Branch where I have these kinds of issues over the years. I would like for CHASE bank to re-credit my account for the initial {$200.00} according to their funds availability policies and refund monies erroneously taken from my account for the overdrawn activity that currently have my account XXXX at ( - {$77.00} ).",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,NY,11233,,Consent provided,Web,06/06/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1409572
212924,2015-04-14,Credit card,,Other fee,,"I am filing this complaint due to the unethical and perhaps illegal treatment I received as a customer of American Express. I had charged less than {$9800.00} in work expenses on my credit card. Waiting for my expenses to be processed, I was inevitably late ( approximately 90 days or less ) in making full payment. My card remained active through XXXX XX/XX/2015. Arbitrarily, American Express effectively charged me over 30 % interest ( 125 % per annum ). And then punitively put negative marks on my credit report. They canceled my card in XXXX XX/XX/2015 even though I paid my balance in full including all late fees before XXXX XXXX. And they have not provided me the opportunity to reinstate my card. Over the 90 days or so, American Express failed to contact me by email, per my stated wishes, via their opt-in program. They chose to ignore this and instead send unregistered letters and phoned an incorrect number as proof of communicating with me. And when I contacted them in late XXXX unilaterally, I paid 33 % of my balance with a stated promise to pay off the entire balance by XXXX XXXX - which I did, 50 % two weeks later and the entire balance actually paid prior to XXXX XXXX. American Express was self-incentivized to cancel my card and act punitively against me. They canceled my account not due to my balance - my balance has been as high as {$20000.00} ( always paid ). By cancelling my account they accrued {$3200.00} by seizing my accrued XXXX member miles ( valued at approximately $ XXXX mile ) plus kept {$200.00} in fees paid for mileage reinstatement. They chose to ignore their bureaucratic errors ( calling the wrong number / not contacting me by email ) and purposely obfuscated the process allowing me to correct those errors with the very personnel that cancelled my account. In real terms, I paid over {$3200.00} XXXX late fees, XX/XX/2015 yearly fee and referenced miles ) for charging and paying off my balance in full. And punitively American Express reports negative information on my credit report. As evidence of this self-dealing and manipulation of rules and laws, I submit to you a cancellation notice I received citing my FICO score as the reason, yet the very same letter invites me to apply for a NEW American Express Card. These miles/points are not an imaginary value ; consumer miles/points of all size and shaped programs are part of corporate financial reporting requirements. This seizure and cancellation should not be allowed. These miles had accrued to me over years. As another example of the corporate culture and processes that led to these actions ; as a customer I am told the calls are being recorded under the all-encompassing purpose of "" quality and training. '' No option is ever given to me to decline the call being recorded. I discovered, that if you inform American Express that you legally will record the call as well, the agents decline and stop the process. Like these phone practices, American Express has total control of the terms and conditions of the credit agreement. The entire process is organized to avoid accountability at every stage. There is no coordination between customer service, risk and bill payment. I had XXXX opportunity to contact the "" risk '' department who cancelled my account because they could not contact me. In summary I paid an exorbitant costs in real dollars and time for mere months of a credit card balance. American Express was enabled to act in an unethical perhaps illegal way.

I returned the vehicle on XXXX XXXX and they found a dent on the fender. As a responsible citizen trying to do the right thing, I filled out the damage report. I contacted my credit card who opened a case and subsequently a claim for me. Card benefit services sent me a list of documents needed from the auto rental corporation, and the damage recovery unit sent over some of the required documents. Card benefit services acknowledged receiving the documents and requested the rest of the documents be sent. 
The damage recovery unit put a representative in charge of my case, whom I have tried to contact both through phone and email on numerous occasions, which is documented in the attached files. He has yet to communicate with me regarding the "" debt '', despite my efforts to reach him. 
I have requested repeatedly from the damage recovery unit to receive the documents needed in order for my credit card to process my claim. Some of these calls and E-mails are in the attached files. Though I was never successful to speak to the recovery specialist in charge of my case, ( he was repeatedly out of town or out of the office, despite the assurance that I can contact him directly at any time ), I was able to speak to several other representatives, who guaranteed that my documents would be sent to the credit card company. As of today XXXX/XXXX/2015, it has not been sent. 
I was sent a demand letter on XXXX/XXXX/2015 from the recovery specialist in charge of my case with a ten days ' notice to repay my debt before my case will be handed over to a collection agency ( see attached Demand E-mail file ). I am in the process of applying for a unit in the XXXX that requires top security clearance, and unsatisfactory credit will disqualify me from being accepted into the unit. I E-mailed them back on XXXX/XXXX/2015 ( see attached response to Demand E-mail file ). I did not receive a response so I called the damage recovery unit on XXXX/XXXX/2015 I demanded to speak to the specialist who signed the demand letter, but was told it is not possible. I did speak to a different specialist who guaranteed me, that the documents would be sent over. She also told me to disregard the demand letter ( see "" told to disregard the demand letter '' recording ( XXXX ) ). 
On XXXX/XXXX/2015, seven days after receiving the demand letter, I received a letter from a collection agency, although the damage recovery unit guaranteed me XXXX days in the demand letter.

This means my credit was negatively affected, concurrently affecting my acceptance into the XXXX unit I am actively trying to join. 
I contacted the damage recovery unit on XXXX/XXXX/2015, and was once again not able to speak to the representative charged with my case. The representative I spoke with admitted that the situation I am in is due to their incompetence, but still refused to cancel the debt with the collection agency, even though it will damage my credit ( see "" final conversation with damage recovery unit '' recording ( XXXX until end ) ). 
As of XXXX/XXXX/2015 they still did not send the necessary documents to the card benefit services, who still have an open claim on my behalf. ( see "" letter from benefit services '' file, "" benefit services not received necessary documents '' recording ).

So Knowing im not a people person due to personal issues. I purchased a car from a local dealer. Being a very busy single mom working and in vital need of transportation for myson to a collage prep XXXX school, and most importantly work means I needed a car fast. Went to a dealer I had done business with and trusted he was honest. Boy was I wrong!,!,! First he made an appointment to have me stop by and pick or look at some vehicles. I did they were mostly over priced. And not to clean. Simply not worth what I was willing to put down for a safe decent car with a lower payment and maybe a bit bigger since my children are still growing. I did find a car and was promised he would give me a great deal and {$4000.00} would be sufficient in addition to another {$300.00} which needed to be received by dealer right away. As promised I did all that was asked of me. I even felt with dealing with just men which kinda made me feel like prey. But I got over that and started to stress the lengthy issue and picking my son up on time. Well Later after my purchase I had some kinda issue with the car and could n't figure it found out from advance auto that there 's was a device in my car that would shut the car off if I was extremely late and avoiding them but I did one of that. I had direct payment. Also the first week my boss and auto body noticed small sounds and the drivers seatbelt work sometimes with great effort. In addition to that the sunroof started to have issues and one day I stopped at the dealership asked for or someone to look at the issue, and to my surprise a hooka pen. I do n't smoke XXXX. It cracked the plastic casing and the dealer had someone close it due to winter arriving and the peace that fell off should have been replaced. I started to make complaints regarding these issues .but nothing was done.

213062,2015-09-09,Credit card,,Billing disputes,,"Dear Sir or Madam : I am writing to file a complaint against USAA following their handling of a dispute of a billing error in the amount of {$1300.00} XXXX on my USAA XXXX XXXX account. The amount is inaccurate because, while I have never disputed purchasing the items from merchant XXXX XXXX XXXX, I do dispute the amount the merchant charged for the items. 

My wife and I purchased XXXX gold-plated pendants approximately the size of a dime. The total amount for XXXX pendants was supposed to be approximately {$130.00} XXXX. When we checked our bank statement a few days following the purchase, we noticed that the merchant charged {$1300.00} XXXX for the purchase. USAA emailed us after freezing our account because they noticed suspicious activity that did n't fit our purchasing history. After our account was frozen I immediately reached out to USAA for assistance and asked if we should return the items to avoid any issues. While we were promised a response within 24 hours, we did n't hear back from them. 

As a result, I looked into the matter on our own and, after further review, I think the salesperson at the checkout counter did n't type in the exchange rate correctly ( I believe she left out a zero ). I think this happened because the woman at the counter was using a calculator to do the math. On XXXX/XXXX/15 XXXX exchange rate was XXXX. I believe the approximate amount of our purchase was supposed to be {$130.00} XXXX. If you do the conversion correctly for {$130.00} XXXX it is : XXXX XXXX x XXXX = {$130.00} XXXX. However, it looks like they left out a zero - XXXX XXXX XXXX x XXXX = {$1300.00} XXXX XXXX. Accordingly, I believe the {$1300.00} XXXX charge is due to this miscalculation ( $ XXXX = XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX is the approximate total I remember for these XXXX pieces ). I 've attached a copy of the XXXX exchange rate on XXXX/XXXX/15, as well as a copy of the receipt from this transaction. 

If one were to examine my credit history, a purchase in the amount of more than {$1300.00} USD is completely out of the ordinary for my jewelry spending as I only spent {$1100.00} XXXX on my wife 's wedding band and would never purchase gold-plated pendants for such an astronomical price. 

After more than two months of contacting USAA for assistance with this dispute and receiving conflicting information during each conversation ( including contacting USAA while I was XXXX asking if I should return the items to avoid any issues ), USAA has informed me that the charge was valid and only gave me a copy of the receipt from the transaction. USAA never addressed my dispute, which was the amount charged - I told USAA that I did purchase jewelry from this merchant and am happy to pay the correct amount, but that the amount the merchant charged is incorrect. Furthermore, the receipt does n't indicate the XXXX equivalent and the merchant never offered to provide the total XXXX. Had I seen the XXXX amount on this receipt I definitely would not have agreed to the charges and would have noticed the salesperson 's error ; however, while dealing with an unfamiliar foreign currency I did n't notice this gross mistake. In addition, the merchant removed the tags from the jewelry and kept them, so we have no way to prove the accurate cost of the jewelry. However, we did pull the price for similar items from their website - gold-plated pendants - and the prices were between $ XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ; XXXX XXXX ). As you can see, they are not worth {$1300.00}. 

I am requesting that the error be corrected, that any finance and other charges related to the disputed amount be credited as well, and that I receive an accurate statement.

Please see the attached original mortgage note which shows this loan originated on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX with the original principal balance of {$410000.00} with a rate of 6.125 %. This was a full document loan with good credit. I had been promised a 5.875 % according to the attached commitment letter but at the time of closing, I was told the rate was locked at 6.125 %. As you can see on the HUD XXXX settlement statement, I was charged {$10000.00} to the broker and what I was informed well after the fact the broker also made the yield spread on the rate of {$7300.00} for a total of {$17000.00} on a rate and term refinance. The purpose of this loan was to combine the XXXX and XXXX liens which were both taken at the same time when the home was purchased. This loan also had PMI for being over 76 % LTV according to the disclosures so this should be considered a conventional loan. HSBC contacted me to modify my loan back in XXXX of XXXX reducing the rate from 6.125 % down to 5 % but was a step rate modification set to increase to 6 % XXXX and then to 6.125 % for the remaining 40 year term which was extended from 30 years. So this modification was raising my rate higher than it even was. And extending my term. The modified loan amount was {$400000.00} after including an unpaid principal balance of {$400000.00} making the new money amount only {$3400.00} which was just a little more than XXXX payment I was due as they told me to hold off paying that because the refinance was going through. At the closing, when I saw the rate would be increasing after 5 years, I was told not to worry, they will refinance or modify this loan before that happens when it is time to remove the PMI I was paying monthly.The reason my loan fell delinquent was because back in XXXX of XXXX, XXXX XXXX hit our area devastating many homes and leaving a wake of damage. Although the damages to my property was not severe compared to many, I still depleted my savings to remove a down tree across the driveway and repair the fence and roof. That same month due to the decline in business and damage to the offices, I had lost my XXXX job after 9 years with XXXX XXXX XXXX, which was a reduction in income of {$2400.00} a month. My monthly net income was nowhere near enough to cover my mortgage payment, let alone any of my other expenses. I was in shock after now having no savings and no additional income, I quickly applied for a loan modification which took several months for a decision to finally be made and I was declined. I was declined several times thereafter for different reasons from the value of the home to having too much debt when I have nothing on credit but my mortgage or not enough income which my income is at a 35 % ratio during the last review which is not out of range. The most recent denial was from XXXX/XXXX/XXXX stating I do not show sufficient income in addition to my monthly expenses. I was advised my monthly expenses were calculated to be much higher than they were and I was told it was due to accounts reporting to credit. I quickly pulled a tri-merge credit through XXXX and the only open credit account is this mortgage. There are no liens, no collections and no charge-offs or judgments. HSBC advised me to forward that credit and they will get back to me but never did and never addressed this. I was told I can just re-apply.
